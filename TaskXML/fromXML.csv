2-s2.0-84873919500.xml,"An increasing number of high-performance networks provision dedicated channels through circuit switching or MPLS/GMPLS techniques to support large data transfer. The link bandwidths in such networks are typically shared by multiple users through advance reservation, resulting in varying bandwidth availability in future time. Developing efficient scheduling algorithms for advance bandwidth reservation has become a critical task to improve the utilization of network resources and meet the transport requirements of application users. We consider an exhaustive combination of different path and bandwidth constraints and formulate four types of advance bandwidth scheduling problems, with the same objective to minimize the data transfer end time for a given transfer request with a prespecified data size: 1) fixed path with fixed bandwidth (FPFB); 2) fixed path with variable bandwidth (FPVB); 3) variable path with fixed bandwidth (VPFB); and 4) variable path with variable bandwidth (VPVB). For VPFB and VPVB, we further consider two subcases where the path switching delay is negligible or nonnegligible. We propose an optimal algorithm for each of these scheduling problems except for FPVB and VPVB with nonnegligible path switching delay, which are proven to be NP-complete and nonapproximable, and then tackled by heuristics. The performance superiority of these heuristics is verified by extensive experimental results in a large set of simulated networks in comparison to optimal and greedy strategies. © 1993-2012 IEEE."

Recently, we reported such a general assay, chemical complementation, which links enzyme catalysis to reporter gene transcription in vivo using the yeast three-hybrid assay. In this proof-of-principle experiment, it was shown that a wild-type β-lactamase enzyme could be isolated from a pool of inactive mutants using a lacZ screen. Ideally, however, such an assay should be able to distinguish enzymes based on their catalytic activity. Thus, here, we set out to determine if the catalytic efficiency of an enzyme variant does in fact correlate with its level of transcription activation in the chemical complementation assay. First, the reaction mechanism for the cleavage of the β-lactam substrate used in the chemical complementation proof-of-principle experiment was determined. Then a series of β-lactamase variants was designed to span several orders of magnitude in k"

Only the route showing the reverse initiation of tert-butyl methacrylate on potassium alkoxide leads to the pure star, whereas the other strategies lead to incomplete initiation because of either an increase in the side reactions, such as transesterification, or a decrease in the accessibility toward bulky catalysts. These limits are linked to the particular location of the initiating group at the junction of the two blocks of the copolymer precursor. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-84874079335.xml,"In combination with a single-crystal diamond anvil cell (DAC), a polycapillary half-lens (PHL) re-focusing optics has been used to perform high-pressure extended X-ray absorption fine-structure measurements. It is found that a large divergent X-ray beam induced by the PHL leads the Bragg glitches from single-crystal diamond to be broadened significantly and the intensity of the glitches to be reduced strongly so that most of the DAC glitches are efficiently suppressed. The remaining glitches can be easily removed by rotating the DAC by a few degrees with respect to the X-ray beam. Accurate X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) spectra of polycrystalline Ge powder with a glitch-free energy range from -200 to 800 eV relative to the Ge absorption edge are obtained using this method at high pressures up to 23.7 GPa, demonstrating the capability of PHL optics in eliminating the DAC glitches for high-pressure XAFS experiments.

2-s2.0-84874228477.xml,"The dynamics of infectious diseases that are spread through direct contact have been proven to depend on the strength of community structure or modularity within the underlying network. It has been recently shown that weighted networks with similar modularity values may exhibit different mixing styles regarding the number of connections among communities and their respective weights. However, the effect of mixing style on epidemic behavior was still unclear. In this paper, we simulate the spread of disease within networks with different mixing styles: a dense-weak style (i.e., many edges among the communities with small weights) and a sparse-strong style (i.e., a few edges among the communities with large weights). Simulation results show that, with the same modularity: 1) the mixing style significantly influences the epidemic size, speed, pattern and immunization strategy; 2) the increase of the number of communities amplifies the effect of the mixing style; 3) when the mixing style changes from sparse-strong to dense-weak, there is a 'saturation point', after which the epidemic size and pattern become stable. We also provide a mean-field solution of the epidemic threshold and size on weighted community networks with arbitrary external and internal degree distribution. The solution explains the effect of the second moment of the degree distribution, and a symmetric effect of internal and external connections (incl. degree distribution and weight). Our study has both potential significance for designing more accurate metrics for the community structure and exploring diffusion dynamics on metapopulation networks. © 2013 Min et al."

This paper intends to make up for that omission. A strong case for our moral responsibility to future generations can be established on the grounds of moral rights theory, utilitarianism and justice theory. The paper analyses two practical cases in environmental policy, in order to come to grips with the complicated ethical issues involved in the responsibility to future generations. The cases deal with the management of finite energy sources and of vulnerable resources of biodiversity. The ethical issues involved in these cases have an important bearing on business ethics: future generations should be included among the stakeholders of the firm. The paper concludes with a plea to institutionalize a ""third arena"" for debate and deliberation on the protection of the interests of future generations, next to the arenas of the government and the market.

Design/methodology/approach - A mixed methods approach was used. Questionnaires were distributed to 35 HQMs and 576 employees of three-, four-, and five-star hotels. Interviews were conducted with HQMs. Descriptive statistics, t-test, and analysis of variance were used to analyze the data. All interviews were transcribed, hand coded, and analyzed for themes. Findings - Compared to hotel employees, HQMs had higher scores for all leadership and workforce items. Comparing managers' perceptions revealed a statistically significant difference between three- and four-star with five-star hotels on developing explicit quality policies and measurable objectives. For employees, there were statistically significant differences for most of the questionnaire items between three- and four-star with five-star hotels. HQMs identified inefficient communication systems and failure to develop explicit quality policies and objectives as main reasons for perception incongruences between employees and managers. Research limitations/implications - Two of the seven MBNQA criteria were used in this study; future research utilizing the other five criteria may be beneficial. Practical implications - This study provides hoteliers with quality practice perception differences between HQMs and employees in different star-rated hotels. Knowing these differences should compel hoteliers to review their leadership and workforce practices, identify reasons for discrepancies, and attempt to minimize the gap. Originality/value - No known studies in Malaysia, investigating this issue, have been conducted using a mixed methods approach.

METHODS: Western blotting was used to analyze the expression profile of Axl glycoprotein in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hca-F treated with tunicamycin and PNGase F 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiazol(-zyl)-3,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, extracellular matrix (ECM) invasion assay (in vitro) and tumor metastasis assay (in vivo) were utilized to evaluate the effect of Axl deglycosylation on the Hca-F cell proliferation, invasion and lymphatic metastasis. RESULTS: Tunicamycin and PNGase F treatment markedly inhibited Axl glycoprotein synthesis and expression, proliferation, invasion, and lymphatic metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. In the MTT assay, proliferation was apparent in untreated Hca-F cells compared with treated Hca-F cells.

2-s2.0-1542725025.xml,"The most usual reconstruction after subtotal colectomy is ileo-rectal anastomosis, which requires the removal of the caecum. We propose the treatment of chronic slow-transit constipation with subtotal colectomy and antiperistaltic caecoproctostomy. The sparing of the caecum, the ileo-caecal valve and the distal ileal loop, leaving a physiologic reservoir, allowing the presence of colic bacterial flora which metabolises the undigested starch and produces short chain fatty acids, should guarantee a normal stool consistency, normal absorption of water, sodium and vitamin B12 and the prevention of renal and gallbladder lithiasis. In 1992, we started a study on the outcome of 19 patients who had undergone subtotal colectomy and antiperistaltic caeco-rectal anastomosis for slow-transit constipation. The surgical procedure was carried out without any serious complications and without mortality. The mean clinical follow-up was 64 months (range 5-132). Six months after surgery, 13 patients reported normal bowel movements with solid stool consistency, 5 reported diarrhoea and the need for antidiarrhoeal agents, and one reported constipation easily controlled with laxatives. Fifteen patients considered their quality of life as having improved compared with that before surgery. Selection of patients justify such very satisfying results. It is well known that colic resection is effective only in the case of slow transit constipation, and thus a careful physiologic assessment is needed to rule out other causes of constipation, such as outlet obstruction syndrome."
2-s2.0-84874013087.xml,"The clinical complications derived from metastatic disease are responsible for the majority of all breast cancer related deaths. Since cell migration and invasion are a prerequisite for metastasis their assessment in patient cancer cells in vitro may have prognostic value for the tumor's metastatic capacity. We employed real-time cell analysis (RTCA) on the xCELLigence DP system to determine in vitro motility of patient-derived primary human breast cancer epithelial cells (HBCEC). Initially, the RTCA assay was validated using established human breast cancer cell lines with either an invasive (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435s) or a non-invasive phenotype (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468), and primary NSCLC cells (Tu459). Previous standard assays of cell migration/invasion revealed that only MDA-MB-231, -435s, and Tu459 cells exhibited spontaneous and TGF-β1-stimulated migration and invasion through a Matrigel barrier. In the present study, the TGF-β1-stimulated activities could be blocked by SB431542, a potent kinase inhibitor of the TGF-β type I receptor ALK5. Application of the RTCA assay to patient-derived tumor cells showed that 4/4 primary HBCEC and primary NSCLC cells, but not normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), displayed high spontaneous migratory and invasive activity which correlated with higher MMP-2 expression and uPA protein levels in HBCEC compared to HMEC. Upon treatment with TGF-β1, HBCEC exhibited morphologic and gene regulatory alterations indicative of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, exclusively the invasive but not the migratory activity of HBCEC was further enhanced by TGF-β1. This indicates the requirement for molecular, e.g. integrin interactions with Matrigel components in HBCEC in order to become responsive to pro-invasive TGF-β effects. Together, these results show for the first time that tumorigenic HBCEC but not normal HMEC possess a strong basal migratory as well as a basal and TGF-β1-inducible invasive potential. These findings qualify the RTCA assay as an in vitro migration/invasion testing system for patient-specific primary breast cancer cells. © 2013 Mandel et al."

Assessing this topic is important in worldwide declining taxa such as reptiles. Previous studies focussed on animal welfare issues and examined short-term effects (e.g. increase of stress hormones due to handling). Long-term effects with possible consequences at the population level remain poorly investigated. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of widely used field procedures (e.g. handling, marking, forced regurgitation) both on short-term (hormonal stress response) and on long-term (changes in body condition, survival) scales in two intensively monitored populations of sea kraits (Laticauda spp.) in New Caledonia. Focusing on the most intensively monitored sites, from 2002 to 2012, we gathered approximately 11 200 captures/recaptures on 4500 individuals. Each snake was individually marked (scale clipping + branding) and subjected to various measurements (e.g. body size, head morphology, palpation). In addition, a subsample of more than 500 snakes was forced to regurgitate their prey for dietary analyses. Handling caused a significant stress hormonal response, however we found no detrimental long-term effect on body condition. Forced regurgitation did not cause any significant effect on both body condition one year later and survival. These results suggest that the strong short-term stress provoked by field procedures did not translate into negative effects on the population. Although similar analyses are required to test the validity of our conclusions in other species, our results suggest distinguishing welfare and population issues to evaluate the potential impact of population surveys. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012."

The Bayes factor is calculated from the marginal prior and posterior densities of the locations of the QTL under a linkage and a pleiotropy model. The procedure is computed with a Gibbs sampler, and it can be easily applied to any model including the location of the QTL as a variable. The procedure was compared with a multivariate least-squares method. The proposed procedure showed better results in terms of power of detection of linkage when low information is available. As information increases, the performance of both procedures becomes similar. An example using data provided by an Iberian by Landrace pig intercross is presented. The results showed that three different QTL segregate in SSC6: a pleiotropic QTL affects myristic, palmitic, and eicosadienoic fatty acids; another pleiotropic QTL affects palmitoleic, stearic, and vaccenic fatty acids; and a third QTL affects the percentage of linoleic acid.

Successive phosphorylation cascades mediated by MAPKs serve as sensitive switches initiating various cellular processes. Apart from this basic feature, the underlying reaction network is capable of displaying other nonlinear phenomena including bistable steady states and hysteresis as well as periodic oscillations. We show that from the mechanistic point of view, bistability is a consequence of interaction between single and double phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pathways in a Stage 2 subsystem of the Huang-Ferrell model. Within this subsystem we uncover the core subnetwork obtained by systematic reduction relying on the methods of stoichiometric network analysis. For the core model we show that there is either one stable steady state or three steady states of which two are stable and point out the role of interplay between the single and double phosphorylation subnetworks in generating bistability. © 2013 American Institute of Physics."

The method is algebraically equivalent with the popular block-centered finite difference method and with the mixed-hybrid finite element method, but is algorithmically different and has the same robustness as the more conventional node-based velocity-oriented method.

2-s2.0-84873930629.xml,"Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in man, are complex diseases in which genetic and environmental factors interact to promote an excessive mucosal immune response directed against normal components of the bacterial microflora. There is also evidence that the pathologic process is due to defects in counterregulatory mechanisms, such as those involving the immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Indeed, studies in human IBD tissues and murine models of colitis have documented a disruption of TGF-β1 signalling marked by a block in the phosphorylation of Smad3, a signalling molecule associated with the activated TGF-β receptor, due to up-regulation of Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of Smad3 phosphorylation. Knock-down of Smad7 with a specific antisense oligonucleotide restores TGF-β1/Smad3 signalling, thus resulting in a marked suppression of inflammatory cytokine production and attenuation of murine colitis. These findings together with the demonstration that Smad7 antisense oligonucleotide is not toxic when administered in mice have paved the way for the development of a Smad7 antisense oligonucleotidebased pharmaceutical compound that is now ready to enter the clinics. In this article we review the available data supporting the pathogenic role of Smad7 in IBD and discuss whether and how Smad7 antisense therapy could help dampen the ongoing inflammation in IBD. © 2012 Baishideng.

Method This was an observational open label study of 40 depressed patients with DM who were randomly assigned to receive either agomelatine or sertraline, and were assessed over a 4-month period for depression, anxiety, self-care, fasting plasma glucose, haemoglobin A1c and body weight. Results Lower anxiety and depression scores as well as higher self-care scores were measured in the agomelatine group compared with the sertraline group after 4 months of treatment. Although the main effects of treatment on final body weight and fasting plasma glucose were not significant, significantly lower final haemoglobin A1c levels were measured in the agomelatine group compared with the sertraline group. Both antidepressants were well tolerated and none of the patients dropped-out of the study. Conclusion The main finding of the present small pilot study was that agomelatine may be a promising agent in the treatment of symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as in the improvement of health-related behaviours, in depressed patients with type 2 DM possibly offering some advantages over sertraline.

2-s2.0-84873988284.xml,"In this study, the feasibility of acoustical analysis for detection of swallowing silent aspiration is investigated. As a pilot study, we analyzed the breath sounds of 21 dysphagic individuals, 11 of which demonstrated aspiration during the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) or videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). We found that the low frequency components of the power spectrum of the breath sounds after a swallow show higher magnitude when there is aspiration. Thus, we divided the frequency range below 300 Hz into three sub-bands and calculated the average power of the breath sound signal in each sub-band as the characteristic features for the stage 1 classification into two groups of aspirated and non-aspirated patients. Then, for the aspirated group, the unsupervised fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm was deployed to label the breath sounds immediately after a swallow as aspiration or non-aspiration. The results were compared with the FEES/VFSS assessments provided by the speech language pathologists. The results are encouraging: more than 86 % accuracy in detection of silent aspiration. While the proposed method should be verified on a larger dataset, the results are promising for the use of acoustical analysis as a clinical tool to detect silent aspiration. © 2012 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering."
2-s2.0-1542305659.xml,"Expressions are given for the overall reflection and transmission coefficients of a multilayered structure consisting of metamaterial and dielectric slabs. Small-reflection approximations are discussed. Two applications are proposed: anti-reflection coatings and high-reflection coatings. For the first application, a structure consisting of two slabs of the same width and opposite permittivities is studied. If the structure is placed between two semi-infinite media of the same kind, the reflection vanish, while if these two media are different, the reflection depends only on their characteristics and on the angle of incidence. This device could be advantageously used as an antenna radome. For the second application, a structure consisting of a large number of identical pairs of slabs of high and low opposite permittivities and of the same widths, embedded in the same medium, is studied. This structure's transmittance variation with frequency shows no ripples, and has a large passband and a monotonous quasi-symmetric rise to the right and to the left of the central frequency.

The model has been used to determine the water contamination due to sewage outfalls in the bay and to evaluate pollution control strategies to meet water quality criteria for recreational purposes. The Quincy Bay model has two parts: a hydrodynamic model and a pathogen fate model. The hydrodynamic model provides a quantitative description of water circulation and mixing of Quincy Bay. The pathogen fate model uses the transport fields generated by the hydrodynamic model to predict the distributions of specific pathogens associated with fecal contamination. The modeling framework, used to determine the abundance of enteric organisms in Quincy Bay, includes pathogen loads from the outfalls and shoreline sources, dispersion and loss processes that include phototoxicity, temperature, salinity, predation or die-off and settling. The ability of the model to simulate advective and dispersive processes in Quincy Bay was assessed by comparing model results against observed temperature, salinity and fecal coliform. Overall the model performs very well. The model response to the atmospheric cooling event observed in mid-September, 2001 and to the rainfall events was very good. After the model was calibrated and validated, six alternatives of outfall locations were evaluated under four different storm scenarios."

This study investigated the prevalence of intestinal parasites in dogs in the Chenaran County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran. Sampling was carried out randomly in 17 villages from November 2009 to January 2010. Seventy-seven fecal samples from 28 domestic and 49 stray dogs were examined using sieving/flotation and modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Intestinal parasites were found in 51 of the 77 (66%) dogs most common being Toxascaris leonina (29%, 22/77), Toxocara spp. (25%, 19/77), Eimeria spp. (19%, 15/77), Taenia/. Echinococcus spp. (18%, 14/77), Sarcocystis spp. (17%, 13/77), and Dicrocoelium dendriticum (14%, 11/77). Lower infection rates of parasites were observed for Trichuris vulpis (6%, 5/77), Cryptosporidium spp. (5%, 4/77), and Physaloptera spp. (3%, 2/77). Prevalence of infection by Dipylidium caninum, Capillaria spp., Cystoisospora spp., and hookworms was similar (1%, 1/77).

The method proposed in this paper exploits the electronic beam steering, achieved by simply inserting an appropriate digital word in the antenna feeding circuit, to resolve two signals. A genetic algorithm was used to determine the strengths and the angular positions of the incoming signals in the azimuth plane. The results obtained concentrate on wideband signaling in a multipath environment, with and without the presence of noise. The antenna design and the reliability of the direction-finding method are presented. The proposed method is strongly dependent on the type of the receiving antenna (a switched parasitic planar array is superior to a ""uniform"" antenna with identical radiation patterns). Increasing the number of radiation patterns available improves the reliability of the method. The reliability of the method slightly deteriorates, as the angular discrimination of the incoming signals becomes smaller, but the results remain quite satisfying."

However, the subsequent use of transmission electron microscopy showed that, for all of the protozoans and cell types examined, endocytosis, classically defined as involving the formation of a membrane-bound vacuole, took place during the interaction process.

2-s2.0-1442360988.xml,"We present a robust iterative method to solve the inverse scattering problem in cases where the Born approximation is valid. We formulate this linearized inverse problem in terms of the unknown material contrast and the unknown contrast sources and we solve the problem by minimizing a cost functional consisting of two terms. The first term represents the differences between the actual data and the modeled data, while the second term represents the misfit in the constitutive relations between the contrast sources and the incident fields. In each iteration, the contrast sources and the contrast are reconstructed alternatingly, using subsequently a conjugate gradient step for the contrast source updates and a direct inversion of a diagonal matrix for the contrast. A further regularization with a multiplicative regularization factor is discussed. In this regularization procedure the relative variation of the contrast is minimized as well. As a test case we consider the two-dimensional (2-D) transverse magnetic polarization problem. Synthetic numerical examples are presented in order to compare the presented algorithm to the traditional Born algorithm. Results with respect to the inversion of experimental data are presented as well. In addition, some inversion results for the subsurface sensing problem, both in two and three dimensions, are presented."
2-s2.0-84873908474.xml,"AIM: To investigate the protective effect and mechanisms of ghrelin postconditioning against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced injury in human gastric epithelial cells. METHODS: The model of H/R injury was established in gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1) human gastric epithelial cells. Cells were divided into seven groups: normal control group (N); H/R postconditioning group; DMSO postconditioning group (DM); ghrelin postconditioning group (GH); D-Lys3-GHRP-6 + ghrelin postconditioning group (D + GH); capsazepine + ghrelin postconditioning group (C + GH); and LY294002 + ghrelin postconditioning group (L + GH). 3-(4,5-dimethylthazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to detect GES-1 cell viability. Hoechst 33258 fluorochrome staining and flow cytometry were conducted to determine apoptosis of GES-1 cells. Spectrophotometry was performed to determine release of lactate dehydrogenate (LDH). Protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β was determined by western blotting. Expression of vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1), Akt and GSK-3β was observed by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the H/R group, cell viability of the GH group was significantly increased in a dosedependent manner (55.9% ± 10.0% vs 69.6% ± 9.6%, 71.9% ± 17.4%, and 76.3% ± 13.3%). Compared with the H/R group, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the GH group significantly decreased (12.38% ± 1.51% vs 6.88% ± 0.87%). Compared with the GH group, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the D + GH group, C + GH group and L + GH groups significantly increased (11.70% ± 0.88%, 11.93% ± 0.96%, 10.20% ± 1.05% vs 6.88% ± 0.87%). There were no significant differences in the percentage of apoptotic cells between the H/R and DM groups (12.38% ± 1.51% vs 13.00% ± 1.13%). There was a significant decrease in LDH release following ghrelin postconditioning compared with the H/R group (561.58 ± 64.01 U/L vs 1062.45 ± 105.29 U/L). There was a significant increase in LDH release in the D + GH, C + GH and L + GH groups compared with the GH group (816.89 ± 94.87 U/L, 870.95 ± 64.06 U/L, 838.62 ± 118.45 U/L vs 561.58 ± 64.01 U/L). There were no significant differences in LDH release between the H/R and DM groups (1062.45 ± 105.29 U/L vs 1017.65 ± 68.90 U/L). Compared with the H/R group, expression of Bcl-2 and Akt increased in the GH group, whereas expression of Bax and GSK- 3β decreased. Compared with the GH group, expression of Bcl-2 decreased and Bax increased in the D + GH, C + GH and L + GH groups, and Akt decreased and GSK-3β increased in the L + GH group. The H/R group also upregulated expression of VR1 and GSK-3β and downregulated Akt. The number of VR1-positive and Akt-positive cells in the GH group significantly increased, whereas the number of GSK-3β-positive cells significantly decreased. These effects of ghrelin were reversed by capsazepine and LY294002. CONCLUSION: Ghrelin postconditioning protected against H/R-induced injury in human gastric epithelial cells, which indicated that this protection might be associated with GHS-R, VR1 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. © 2012 Baishideng.

2-s2.0-84873986426.xml,"Inflammatory lesions, ischemic tissues, or solid tumors are characterized by the occurrence of severe tissue hypoxia within the diseased tissue. Subsequent stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors - particularly of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A) - results in significant alterations of gene expression of resident cells or inflammatory cells that have been recruited into such lesions. Interestingly, studies of hypoxia-induced changes of gene expression identified a transcriptional program that promotes extracellular adenosine signaling. Adenosine is a signaling molecule that functions through the activation of four distinct adenosine receptors - the ADORA1, ADORA2A, ADORA2B, and ADORA3 receptors. Extracellular adenosine is predominantly derived from the phosphohydrolysis of precursor nucleotides, such as adenosine triphosphate or adenosine monophosphate. HIF1A-elicited alterations in gene expression enhance the enzymatic capacity within inflamed tissues to produce extracellular adenosine. Moreover, hypoxia-elicited induction of adenosine receptors - particularly of ADORA2B - results in increased signal transduction. Functional studies in genetic models for HIF1A or adenosine receptors implicate this pathway in an endogenous feedback loop that dampens excessive inflammation and promotes injury resolution, while at the same time enhancing ischemia tolerance. Therefore, pharmacological strategies to enhance HIF-elicited adenosine production or to promote adenosine signaling through adenosine receptors are being investigated for the treatment of acute inflammatory or ischemic diseases characterized by tissue hypoxia. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2-s2.0-1642351380.xml,"Purpose: In order to establish a more faithful model of clinically recurrent ovarian cancer after paclitaxel-based chemotherapy, a paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line was established in vivo, and its biological profiles were compared with the conventional in vitro established drug-resistant cell line. Methods: An in vivo paclitaxel-resistant subline (OM1/ Tvivo) was established from the parental human ovarian cancer cell line (OVMG1) by repeated paclitaxel administration into tumor-bearing mice. As a control, the in vivo drug-sensitive subline (OM1/Cvivo) was made in the same manner, without paclitaxel. An in vitro paclitaxel-resistant subline (OM1/Tvitro) was established by exposure to stepwise increased concentrations of the drug in a cell culture medium. Chromosomal analysis, evaluation of growth, invasiveness and metastasis, in vivo and in vitro drug sensitivity, and a pharmacokinetic study were performed. Results: Both in vivo sublines confirmed their human origin by G-band chromosomal analysis and showed a similar cell growth rate in cell culture. As for in vivo tumor growth, OM1/ Tvivo showed enhanced tumor growth property compared with OM1/Cvivo, while OM1/Tvitro lost tumorigenicity. Both OM1/Tvivo and OM1/Cvivo sublines as well as their parental OVMG1 could not form either invasive or metastatic lesions. Compared with the OM1/ Cvivo subline, the OM1/Tvivo tumor showed stable drug-resistance and lower drug distribution after paclitaxel administration into mice, whereas cultured OM1/ Tvivo cells lost both completely. On the other hand, an unreasonably higher level of drug-resistance and lower drug concentration was detected in vitro only in OM1/ Tvitro cells after exposure to the drug in a culture medium. Conclusions: These results suggest that the in vivo established paclitaxel-resistant cell line, rather than the conventional in vitro established cell line, is a suitable and faithful model for clinically recurrent tumors showing transformed aggressiveness. The in vivo specific drug-resistant mechanism should involve an interaction between the tumor and host stromal tissue rather than only changes in cellular drug sensitivity. The present study is probably the first report of an in vivo established paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line, and the elucidation of such an in vivo drug-resistance mechanism may be clinically important in preventing or overcoming acquired drug-resistant ovarian cancers recurring after paclitaxel-based chemotherapy."

For the search, the keywords used were: intussusception, IFP, intussusception and IFP, intussusception due to IFP, and IFP presenting as intussusception. The search covered all articles from 1976 to November 2011. RESULTS: We present a 38-year-old woman who was admitted 10 d after experiencing abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea. Ultrasonography demonstrated small bowel intussusception. An ileal intussusception due to a mass lesion 50 cm proximal to the ileocecal junction was found during laparotomy. Partial ileal resection and anastomosis were performed. A diagnosis of ileal IFP was made based on the immunohistochemical findings. In addition, a total of 56 reports concerning 85 cases of intussusception due to IFP meeting the aforementioned criteria was included in the literature review. The patients were aged 4 to 81 years (mean, 49 ± 16.2 years); 44 were women (mean, 51.8 ± 14.3 years) and 41 were men (mean, 46 ± 17.5 years). According to the location of the IFP, ileal intussusception was found in 63 patients, while 17 had jejunal, three had colonic, and two had ileojejunal intussusception.

Detection of this compound has been described in several species of procelariiform seabirds and non-Antarctic fish-feeding penguins. However, there is no evidence of DMS detection by krill-feeding penguins. The mechanisms of krill detection by its predators are especially relevant in Antarctica, where trophic webs are mainly based on krill. We explored for the first time whether a krill-feeding penguin species, the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica, is able to detect DMS. We examined whether chinstrap penguins could detect DMS by locating DMS or control recipients in pathways that penguins used when moving between the colony and the sea. We also analysed the attraction of nestling penguins to DMS in a T-shaped experimental enclosure. Our results showed that adult penguins are attracted to DMS on land. Nestling penguins also tended to be attracted to the scent of DMS. Further research is needed to examine whether chinstrap penguins use natural DMS concentrations as a foraging cue at sea. © Inter-Research 2013."
2-s2.0-84874129021.xml,"Discrete wavelet transforms are extensively preferred in biomedical signal processing for denoising, feature extraction, and compression. This paper presents a new denoising method based on the modeling of discrete wavelet coefficients of ECG in selected sub-bands with Kernel density estimation. The modeling provides a statistical distribution of information and noise. A Gaussian kernel with bounded support is used for modeling sub-band coefficients and thresholds and is estimated by placing a sliding window on a normalized cumulative density function. We evaluated this approach on offline noisy ECG records from the Cardiovascular Research Centre of the University of Glasgow and on records from the MIT-BIH Arrythmia database. Results show that our proposed technique has a more reliable physical basis and provides improvement in the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Percentage RMS Difference (PRD). The morphological information of ECG signals is found to be unaffected after employing denoising. This is quantified by calculating the mean square error between the feature vecto s of original and denoised signal. MSE values are less than 0.05 for most of the cases. © 2012 KIPS."
2-s2.0-84874245892.xml,"In recent years, our understanding of the role of natural killer (NK) cells in the response to viral infection has grown rapidly. Not only do we realize viruses have many immune-evasion strategies to escape NK cell responses, but that stimulation of NK cell subsets during an antiviral response occurs through receptors seemingly geared directly at viral products and that NK cells can provide a memory response to viral pathogens. Tremendous knowledge has been gained in this area through the study of herpes viruses, but appreciation for the significance of NK cells in the response to other types of viral infections is growing. The function of NK cells in defense against poxviruses has emerged over several decades beginning with the early seminal studies showing the role of NK cells and the NK gene complex in susceptibility of mouse strains to ectromelia, a poxvirus pathogen of mice. More recently, greater understanding has emerged of the molecular details of the response. Given that human diseases caused by poxviruses can be as lethal as smallpox or as benign as Molluscum contagiosum, and that vaccinia virus, the prototypic member of the pox family, persists as a mainstay of vaccine design and has potential as an oncolytic virus for tumor therapy, further research in this area remains important. This review focuses on recent advances in understanding the role of NK cells in the immune response to poxviruses, the receptors involved in activation of NK cells during poxvirus infection, and the viral evasion strategies poxviruses employ to avoid the NK response. © 2013 Burshtyn."

New technologies like functional brain mapping contributed to the new concept of a ""weight regulating network"" within the hypothalamus. Leptin and ghrelin are circulating factors that inform the hypothalamic network on peripheral energy needs. Psychological theories of adjustment of hunger and satiety comply with the neuroendocrinologic evidence and complete our understanding of body weight control. The disinhibition/restriction hypothesis of Herman and Polivy describes disturbed eating behaviour which is relevant for bulimia nervosa and bulimic forms of anorexia nervosa but especially for weight reduction by caloric restriction in obesity. Consequentially, long-term weight loss in obese patients cannot be achieved by short-term changes of energy balance but only by long-term changes of life style. Hunger, if present, not only before meal time will threaten the maintenance of weight reduction. Thus restriction of caloric intake is limited by the subjective energy needs rather than by total energy expenditure."

The incidence of dead plants following inoculation with R. solani alone was only 5% and in plants inoculated simultaneously with both pathogens, disease incidence was 88% 35 days after inoculation. Mortality reached 90-100% in plants inoculated with P. myriotylum, either singly or combined with R. solani 60 days after inoculation, whereas in plants inoculated with R. solani it was 5%. The maximum mortality in plants inoculated with R. solani was 25%, 76 days after inoculation. These results clearly demonstrate that P. myriotylum was the dominant pathogen in the root rot and wilt of A. manglesii."

Weshow how the IT architecture of the National Family Benefits Fund in Luxembourg got systematically modernized by solving issues related to Enterprise Application Integration, before introducing concepts like Enterprise Service Bus which was extended to offer service orchestration and business workflow support. By taking advantage of Model Driven Software Design and by introducing a framework for adding new components to the service bus, technical burdens to get used to the new IT environment got minimized. The cost saving due to the open source subsystems and the ease of use make the proposed architecture particularly interesting for small and medium organizations."

This research integrates the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model and the DayCent biogeochemical model to investigate water quality and soil greenhouse gas flux that results when corn stover is collected at two different rates from corn-soybean and continuous corn crop rotations with and without tillage. Multiobjective watershed-scale optimizations are performed for individual pollutant-cost minimization criteria based on the economic cost of each cropping practice and (individually) the effect on nitrate, total phosphorus, sediment, or global warming potential. We compare these results with a purely economic optimization that maximizes stover production at the lowest cost without taking environmental impacts into account. We illustrate trade-offs between cost and different environmental performance criteria, assuming that nutrients contained in any stover collected must be replaced. The key finding is that stover collection using the practices modeled results in increased contributions to atmospheric greenhouse gases while reducing nitrate and total phosphorus loading to the watershed relative to the status quo without stover collection. Stover collection increases sediment loading to waterways relative to when no stover is removed for each crop rotation-tillage practice combination considered; no-till in combination with stover collection reduced sediment loading below baseline conditions without stover collection. Our results suggest that additional information is needed about (i) the level of nutrient replacement required to maintain grain yields and (ii) cost-effective management practices capable of reducing soil erosion when crop residues are removed in order to avoid contributions to climate change and water quality impairments as a result of using corn stover to satisfy the RFS. © 2013 American Chemical Society."
2-s2.0-84873988429.xml,"In this study, the feasibility of acoustical analysis for detection of swallowing silent aspiration is investigated. As a pilot study, we analyzed the breath sounds of 21 dysphagic individuals, 11 of which demonstrated aspiration during the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) or videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). We found that the low frequency components of the power spectrum of the breath sounds after a swallow show higher magnitude when there is aspiration. Thus, we divided the frequency range below 300 Hz into three sub-bands and calculated the average power of the breath sound signal in each sub-band as the characteristic features for the stage 1 classification into two groups of aspirated and non-aspirated patients. Then, for the aspirated group, the unsupervised fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm was deployed to label the breath sounds immediately after a swallow as aspiration or non-aspiration. The results were compared with the FEES/VFSS assessments provided by the speech language pathologists. The results are encouraging: more than 86 % accuracy in detection of silent aspiration. While the proposed method should be verified on a larger dataset, the results are promising for the use of acoustical analysis as a clinical tool to detect silent aspiration. © 2012 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering."

The creation process of the snapshot, as well as the result of the study, aims to help in diagnosing the current status of quality management (QM) and further contribute in understanding and shaping its future direction. For this purpose, all published articles during the last 25 years' period (1987-2011) under the subject of Total Quality Management (TQM), Business Excellence (BE), quality tools, techniques as well as core values/principles have been collected through the ABI/INFORM complete periodical database. The collected data were analysed and reflected in order to show the current status, evolution trends of the past, and the predicted future directions. The results show that the total number of articles under the subject of TQM has been decreasing after having reached its peak in 1995. However, papers focusing on techniques and tools within the QM framework in terms of Lean, Just-in-Time/Toyota Production System, Benchmarking, and Six-Sigma Quality have been increasing. In addition, papers focusing on core values/key principles needed to build a quality culture in terms of leadership, people-based management, continuous improvements, management based on facts, and focus on the customer have been slightly increasing during the last decade. The findings indicate that QM is now at a more mature stage where focuses have shifted from being initially on TQM to tools, techniques, and core values which are needed for building a quality and BE culture. Based on its evolution, it is concluded that TQM can be understood as a management innovation, if not a management revolution. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Both patients underwent intensive video-electroencephalography monitoring, with simultaneous neuropsychological tests. In both patients, reflex epileptic myoclonus was more easily triggered by writing that required a higher degree of concentration. Conversely, other cognitive tasks, such as reading, typing, thinking, or calculation never elicited any seizures or myoclonus. Valproate was effective in controlling both spontaneous and reflex epileptic seizures. The results of this study further support the notion that 'praxis-induced' reflex epilepsy precipitated by specific stimuli occurs in the context of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Our results also illustrate that writing tasks are more effective in eliciting seizures when they require higher levels of concentration and mental elaboration."

2-s2.0-84873924888.xml,"AIM: To perform a meta-analysis of observational studies to further elucidate the relationship between oral bisphosphonate use and gastrointestinal cancer risk. METHODS: Systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies through January 2011. Search terms were ""bisphosphonates"" or trade names of the drugs, and ""observational studies"" or ""cohort studies"" or ""case-control studies"". Two evaluators reviewed and selected articles on the basis of predetermined selection criteria as followed: (1) observational studies (case-control or cohort studies) on bisphosphonate use; (2) with at least 2 years of follow-up; and (3) reported data on the incidence of cancer diagnosis. The DerSimonian and Laird random effects model were used to calculate the pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Two-by-two contingency table was used to calculate the outcomes not suitable for meta-analysis. Subgroup meta-analyses were conducted for the type of cancer (esophageal, gastric and colorectal cancers). Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the effect sizes when only studies with long-term follow-up (mean 5 years; subgroup 3 years) were included. RESULTS: Of 740 screened articles, 3 cohort studies and 3 case-control studies were included in the analyses. At first, 4 cohort studies and 3 case-control studies were selected for the analyses but one cohort study was excluded because the cancer outcomes were not categorized by type of gastrointestinal cancer. More than 124 686 subjects participated in the 3 cohort studies. The mean follow-up time in all of the cohort studies combined was approximately 3.88 years. The 3 case-control studies reported 3070 esophageal cancer cases and 15 417 controls, 2018 gastric cancer cases and 10 007 controls, and 11 574 colorectal cancer cases and 53 955 controls. The percentage of study participants who used bisphosphonate was 2.8% among the cases and 2.9% among the controls. The meta-analysis of all the studies found no significant association between bisphosphonate use and gastrointestinal cancer. Also no statistically significant association was found in a meta-analysis of long-term follow-up studies.

2-s2.0-84873997024.xml,"Electrochemotherapy, a combination of high voltage electric pulses and of an anticancer drug, has been demonstrated to be highly effective in treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors. Unique properties of electrochemotherapy (e.g., high specificity for targeting cancer cells, high degree of localization of treatment effect, capacity for preserving the innate immune response and the structure of the extracellular matrix) are facilitating its wide spread in the clinics. Due to high effectiveness of electrochemotherapy in treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors regardless of histological origin, there are now attempts to extend its use to treatment of internal tumors. To advance the applicability of electrochemotherapy to treatment of internal solid tumors, new technological developments are needed that will enable treatment of these tumors in daily clinical practice. New electrodes through which electric pulses are delivered to target tissue need to be designed with the aim to access target tissue anywhere in the body. To increase the probability of complete tumor eradication, the electrodes have to be accurately positioned, first to provide an adequate extent of electroporation of all tumor cells and second not to damage critical healthy tissue or organs in its vicinity. This can be achieved by image guided insertion of electrodes that will enable accurate positioning of the electrodes in combination with patient-specific numerical treatment planning or using a predefined geometry of electrodes. In order to be able to use electrochemotherapy safely for treatment of internal tumors located in relative proximity of the heart (e.g., in case of liver metastases), the treatment must be performed without interfering with the heart's electrical activity. We describe recent technological advances, which allow treatment of liver and bone metastases, soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, and colorectal and esophageal tumors.

2-s2.0-84874224802.xml,"Supplemental feeding is widely used after the translocation of animals and is presumed to increase post-release survival or reproductive output. However, the results of empirical studies on supplemental feeding are equivocal and research is needed to determine the mechanisms by which supplemental feeding affects health and behaviour. Here, we studied the effect of supplemental feeding on the Brown Teal, or Pateke (Anas chlorotis), an endangered duck endemic to New Zealand, following four translocations of captive-bred individuals. Radio-telemetric monitoring showed no significant effect of supplemental feeding on post-release survival. Male birds dispersed further than females, and supplemental feeding decreased post-release dispersal. To reduce heterospecific competition at Brown Teal feeders, we also tested an exclusion device designed to prevent the main heterospecific competition, the Purple Swamphen (Pukeko in New Zealand, Porphyrio porphyrio melanotus), from accessing supplemental food. Although this device decreased the presence of Purple Swamphens at feeders, it also decreased use of feeders by Brown Teal. Ultimately, we concluded that supplemental feeding has value as a conservation tool for Brown Teal, particularly during releases in managed areas. Further studies on feeder design, as well as spatial and temporal patterns of use of feeders, are needed to maximise the positive effect of supplemental feeding on success of translocations. © BirdLife Australia 2013."

The model was configured into a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and particle tracking model, ITM, which uses neutrally buoyant passive particles as surrogates for ichthyoplankton. In ITM, particles are transported by multidimensional advection and dispersion processes. The model was driven by time-dependent water levels, temperature and salinity along open boundaries, meteorological forcing and freshwater inflows. It was calibrated using observed surface and bottom salinity and temperature, water surface elevations and surface, mid-depth and bottom currents at locations across the New York harbor and the East River during 1994 and 1995. Results indicate that estuarine circulation greatly determined the distribution of particles in the East River. The probability that ichthyoplankton would be entrained into the Charles Poletti plant intake structure was highly dependent on the location and time of their release and the assumption that ichthyoplankton behave like neutrally buoyant particles."

Galectin-3 was highly expressed on macrophages in lesions of patients with the clinically progressive lepromatous form of leprosy; in contrast, galectin-3 was almost undetectable in self-limited tuberculoid lesions. We investigated the potential function of galectin-3 in cell-mediated immunity using peripheral blood monocytes. Galectin-3 enhanced monocyte interleukin 10 production to a TLR2/1 ligand, whereas interleukin 12p40 secretion was unaffected. Furthermore, galectin-3 diminished monocyte to dendritic cell differentiation and T-cell antigen presentation.

Only two similar cases have been reported in the English literature. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed a tuberous filling defect in the middle and superior parts of the common bile duct, and mild stenosis in the inferior duct. Computed tomography (CT) showed a well enhanced mass in the middle and superior parts of the common bile duct. A single cancer of the middle and superior bile duct was suspected and extra-hepatic bile duct resection was performed. CT eleven months after surgery revealed enhanced inferior bile duct wall and a slightly enhanced tumor within it. Retrospective review of the CT images taken before first surgery showed enhanced inferior bile duct wall without intrabiliary tumor only on the delayed phase. The inferior bile duct tumor was suspected to have originally co-existed with the middle and superior bile duct tumor. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed subsequently. Histopathological examination revealed that the middle and superior bile duct tumor was a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma while the inferior bile duct tumor was a papillary adenocarcinoma.

It was found that the pristine high quality SWNTs do not exhibit any ethanol sensitivity, while the introduction of defects in the tubes results in the appearance of the ethanol sensitivity. The CNB network showed ethanol sensitivity without plasma treatment. Both CNB and low defect (after 3 min treatment) SWNT networks exhibit significant drift in the resistance baseline, while heavily plasma-treated (9 min) SWNTs exhibited high ethanol vapor sensitivity without the baseline change. The mechanisms of the ethanol sensitivity and stability after the plasma irradiation are attributed to the formation of sensitive dangling bonds in the SWNTs and formation of defect channels facilitating access of the ethanol vapor to all parts of the bundled nanotubes.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2012 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Several studies demonstrated a moderate stability of cortisol awakening responses on subsequent days, suggesting situation-dependent variance. This study tests whether cortisol awakening responses are different on weekdays compared with weekend days and whether such differences may be explained by chronic work overload and worrying. Methods: Two hundred nineteen participants took saliva samples immediately after awakening and 30, 45, and 60 minutes later on 6 consecutive days starting on Saturday. Perceived chronic work overload and worrying were assessed by a standardized questionnaire. Results: There is a clear weekend-weekday difference in the cortisol response to awakening. This difference is associated with chronic work overload and worry. Independent of sex and weekend-weekday differences in time of awakening and sleep duration, participants who report higher levels of chronic work overload and worrying show a stronger increase and higher mean levels of cortisol after awakening on weekdays, but not on weekend days. Conclusions: The weekend-weekday differences in the cortisol awakening response and their association with chronic stress clearly demonstrate that the day of cortisol assessment is crucial in psychoendocrinological stress studies."

2-s2.0-84874209491.xml,"Background: The advent of next generation sequencing technology has accelerated efforts to map and catalogue copy number variation (CNV) in genomes of important micro-organisms for public health. A typical analysis of the sequence data involves mapping reads onto a reference genome, calculating the respective coverage, and detecting regions with too-low or too-high coverage (deletions and amplifications, respectively). Current CNV detection methods rely on statistical assumptions (e.g., a Poisson model) that may not hold in general, or require fine-tuning the underlying algorithms to detect known hits. We propose a new CNV detection methodology based on two Poisson hierarchical models, the Poisson-Gamma and Poisson-Lognormal, with the advantage of being sufficiently flexible to describe different data patterns, whilst robust against deviations from the often assumed Poisson model.Results: Using sequence coverage data of 7 Plasmodium falciparum malaria genomes (3D7 reference strain, HB3, DD2, 7G8, GB4, OX005, and OX006), we showed that empirical coverage distributions are intrinsically asymmetric and overdispersed in relation to the Poisson model. We also demonstrated a low baseline false positive rate for the proposed methodology using 3D7 resequencing data and simulation. When applied to the non-reference isolate data, our approach detected known CNV hits, including an amplification of the PfMDR1 locus in DD2 and a large deletion in the CLAG3.2 gene in GB4, and putative novel CNV regions. When compared to the recently available FREEC and cn.MOPS approaches, our findings were more concordant with putative hits from the highest quality array data for the 7G8 and GB4 isolates.Conclusions: In summary, the proposed methodology brings an increase in flexibility, robustness, accuracy and statistical rigour to CNV detection using sequence coverage data. © 2013 Sepúlveda et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The sample is illuminated with periodic light patterns, and a series of images are acquired for different pattern positions, also called phases. From these a super-resolution image can be computed. However, for an artefact-free reconstruction it is important that the pattern phases be known with very high precision. If the necessary precision cannot be guaranteed experimentally, the phase information has to be retrieved a posteriori from the acquired data. We present a fast and robust algorithm that iteratively determines these phases with a precision of typically below λ/100. Our method, which is based on cross-correlations, allows optimisation of pattern phase even when the pattern itself is too fine for detection, in which case most other methods inevitably fail. We analyse the performance of this method using simulated data from a synthetic 2D sample as well as experimental single-slice data from a 3D sample and compare it with another previously published approach. © 2013 Optical Society of America."

The authors report on the first large-scale replicated experiment to study the usefulness of nest-box installation for increasing the breeding density of common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and barn owls (Tyto alba) as a potential biological control of common vole (Microtus arvalis) abundance in agricultural habitats in north-western Spain. RESULTS: The results show that: (1) population density of both predator species increased in response to both nest-site availability and vole density; (2) voles are a major prey for the common kestrels during the breeding period; (3) vole density during the increase phase of a population cycle may be reduced in crop fields near nest boxes. CONCLUSION: The installation of nest boxes provides nesting sites for barn owls and kestrels. Kestrel populations increased faster than in areas without artificial nests, and the common vole was one of their main prey during the breeding season. The results suggest that local (field) effects could be found in terms of reduced vole density.

The integrity and thickness of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) and external anal sphincter (EAS) were also evaluated by endoanal ultrasonography. We determined the physical and mental health status with SF-36 score to assess the effect of multiple TEM on patient quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: All patients answered the questionnaire. Apart from negative RAIR in 4 patients, all of the anorectal manometric values in the 21 patients were normal before operation. Mean anal resting pressure decreased from 38 ± 5 mmHg to 19 ± 3 mmHg (38 ± 5 mmHg vs 19 ± 3 mmHg, P = 0.000) and MTV from 165 ± 19 mL to 60 ± 11 mL (165 ± 19 mL vs 60 ± 11 mL, P = 0.000) at month 3 after surgery. Anal resting pressure and MTV were 37 ± 5 mmHg (38 ± 5 mmHg vs 37 ± 5 mmHg, P = 0.057) and 159 ± 19 mL (165 ± 19 mL vs 159 ± 19 mL, P = 0.071), respectively, at month 6 after TEM. Maximal squeeze pressure decreased from 171 ± 19 mmHg to 62 ± 12 mmHg (171 ± 19 mmHg vs 62 ± 12 mmHg, P = 0.000) at week 2 after operation, and returned to normal values by postoperative month 3 (171 ± 19 vs 166 ± 18, P = 0.051). RAIR were absent in 4 patients preoperatively and in 12 (χ2 = 4.947, P = 0.026) patients at month 3 after surgery. RAIR was absent only in 5 patients at postoperative month 6 (χ2 = 0.141, P = 0.707). Endosonography demonstrated that IAS disruption occurred in 8 patients, and 6 patients had temporary incontinence to flatus that was normalized by postoperative month 3. IAS thickness decreased from 1.9 ± 0.6 mm preoperatively to 1.3 ± 0.4 mm (1.9 ± 0.6 mm vs 1.3 ± 0.4 mm, P = 0.000) at postoperative month 3 and increased to 1.8 ± 0.5 mm (1.9 ± 0.6 mm vs 1.8 ± 0.5 mm, P = 0.239) at postoperative month 6. EAS thickness decreased from 3.7 ± 0.6 mm preoperatively to 3.5 ± 0.3 mm (3.7 ± 0.6 mm vs 3.5 ± 0.3 mm, P = 0.510) at month 3 and then increased to 3.6 ± 0.4 mm (3.7 ± 0.6 mm vs 3.6 ± 0.4 mm, P = 0.123) at month 6 after operation. Most patients had frequent stools per day and relatively high Wexner scores in a short time period. While actual fecal incontinence was exceptional, episodes of soiling were reported by 3 patients. With regard to the QoL, the physical and mental health status scores (SF-36) were 56.1 and 46.2 (50 in the general population), respectively. CONCLUSION: The anorectal function after repeated TEM is preserved. Multiple TEM procedures are useful for resection of multi-polyps in the remaining rectum. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-84874181085.xml,"Research with violent offenders and delinquent adolescents suggests that endogenous testosterone concentrations have the strongest positive correlations with violence among men who have low concentrations of cortisol. The present study tested the hypothesis that testosterone and cortisol would similarly interact to determine neural activation in regions supporting self-regulation in response to anger provocation. Nineteen healthy Asian male participants were insulted and asked to control their anger during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). When cortisol levels were low, testosterone positively correlated with activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and thalamus, but not when cortisol levels were high. During induced anger control, functional connectivity was increased between the amygdala and a top-down prefrontal cortical control network. Moreover, the amygdala-PFC connectivity was strongest among those high in testosterone and low in cortisol. This research highlights a possible neural mechanism by which testosterone and cortisol may influence anger control. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

2-s2.0-1442304812.xml,"Mathematical models of fatigue and performance are potentially powerful tools to predict the effects of duty-rest schedules in many situations. Most current models, including the Circadian Alertness Simulator (CAS), derive from the two-process theory of sleep regulation. In these models, performance and fatigue are determined by a homeostatic process that depends solely on sleep/wake history, and a circadian process, driven by the biological clock. These models assume: 1) performance capability recovers in an exponential manner during sleep; 2) the homeostatic and circadian processes are additive. Current evidence suggests that both assumptions require modification. An attractive feature of the CAS is that it computes alertness curves for individuals, based on individual sleep/wake histories and other data. However, statistical evaluation is usually based on group data, with few performance metrics. As in other models, there is no substantive theory to connect the alertness computation with specific cognitive or psychomotor functions."

We introduced the ""level of detail"" approach in time scaling in the environment of dynamic processes where time plays a primary role. In the case of visualization of dynamic phenomena the users are looking for specific dynamic patterns that should help them to understand in a better way the nature of dynamic processes under investigation. A new approach that should meet these requirements has been developed. This approach has been verified by means of two systems used for simulation and visualization of technological processes that are of a dynamic nature."

2-s2.0-1642417508.xml,"Objectives. - To assess the value of MRI and ano-rectal endosonography (ARES) for the diagnosis and surgical prognosis of rectovaginal septum endometriosis and to analyse the surgical management in order to evaluate its functional results and complications. Patients and methods. - Retrospective study of 50 consecutive patients operated for a clinical presumption of endometriosis nodule of the recto vaginal septum. Thirty-nine patients had a MRI, 31 an ARES and 28 both exams. All the patients had a complete dissection of the rectovaginal septum and all lesions were excised. Results. - For the diagnosis of rectovaginal septum endometriosis nodule, MRI results are: sensitivity 73%, specificity 50%, positive predictive value (PPV) 89%, negative predictive value (NPV) 25%; for uterosacral ligaments involvement: sensitivity 84%, specificity 95%, PPV 94%, NPV 86% and for rectal wall infiltration: sensitivity 53%, specificity 82%, PPV 69%, NPV 69%. The ARES results for diagnosis of rectovaginal septum endometriosis nodule are: sensitivity 93%, specificity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 50% and for rectal wall infiltration: sensitivity 100%, specificity 71%, PPV 81%, NPV 100%. ARES appeared more sensitive than MRI for the detection of rectal wall infiltration (P = 0.002) and for rectovaginal septum endometriosis nodule diagnosis (P = 0.03). Eighty-nine percent of the patients had a coelioscopy in first intention and 15 laparoconversions were performed, 11 in order to perform a digestive resection: 45 nodules were found. In 43cases the nodule was excised, associated to 19 digestive resections, 30 colpectomys, and 22 uterosacral ligaments resections. Three patients required an additional surgical treatment by Hartman's procedure with Mickulicz's drainage for peritonitis. Forty-one nodules were endometriosis nodules: the two other cases were fibrosis nodules. Thirty-three patients were interviewed about the evolution of their pains over a mean history of 20 months: 90% of the patients were satisfied with the management results. Discussion and conclusions. - Our data support the efficiency of MRI for rectovaginal septum endometriosis nodule and uterosacral ligaments involvement diagnosis; accord ARES to rectovaginal septum endometriosis nodule diagnosis and its reliability in establishing a diagnosis of rectal wall involvement. The surgical cure of rectovaginal septum nodules without digestive infiltration is performed by coelioscopic or coelio-vaginal procedure, but in case of associated digestive affliction, laparotomy is actually the standard procedure in order to achieve a complete cure of the lesions. Complications, in particular peritonitis, are not frequent. Our data support the efficiency of radical surgical treatment for the improvement of pain symptoms. Results on fertility seem to be satisfactory, but complication risks suggest being careful in this indication. Clinical examination during a catamenial period is essential in order to evoke the diagnosis. MRI yields a complete map of the sub-peritoneal and peritoneal lesions and ARES allows for the diagnosis of an infiltration of the rectal wall. Pre-operative association of those two exams is actually indispensable for the surgical management of those patients, which consists of complete excision of endometriosical lesions and is efficient at treating pain symptoms and fertility. Complications are rare but severe, therefore, justifying a cure in specialised centres. © 2003 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits réservé s."

Commonly used signal molecules include chitin, ergosterol, membrane lipids, and nucleic acids. Several DNA-based fingerprinting methods have been successfully applied to fungal communities, including D/TGGE (denaturing/temperature gradient gel electrophoresis), SSCP (single-stranded conformational polymorphism), RISA (ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis), and T-RFLP (terminal restriction length fragment polymorphism).

2-s2.0-1542467772.xml,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate color Doppler ultrasonography in assessing hand collateral circulation before radial artery harvesting for coronary artery bypass grafting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hand circulation of 30 patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting was assessed by means of the modified Allen test and Doppler ultrasonography dynamic test. The test was performed by recording the flow in the superficial palmar branch of the radial and ulnar arteries with and without compression of the radial artery. In the postoperative period hemodynamic changes in the ulnar artery were also detected by means of Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: Among the 30 patients, one had abnormal and the other 29 had normal Doppler ultrasonography dynamic test results. All the patients' modified Allen test results were also normal. In 14 patients radial artery graft was used in the coronary artery bypass operation. CONCLUSION: Doppler ultrasonography dynamic test is an effective and noninvasive method in the preoperative evaluation of the hand collateral circulation for the safe removal of a radial artery graft."
2-s2.0-84874004589.xml,"Background: The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) is a not-for profit organization committed to providing affordable medicines and access to treatments in resource-poor settings. Traditionally drug development has happened ""in house"" within pharmaceutical companies, with research and development costs ultimately recuperated through drug sales. The development of drugs for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases requires a completely different model that goes beyond the scope of market-driven research and development. Artesunate and mefloquine are well-established drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, with a strong safety record based on many years of field-based studies and use. The administration of such artemisinin-based combination therapy in a fixed-dose combination is expected to improve patient compliance and to reduce the risk of emerging drug resistance. Case description. DNDi developed an innovative approach to drug development, reliant on strong collaborations with a wide range of partners from the commercial world, academia, government institutions and NGOs, each of which had a specific role to play in the development of a fixed dose combination of artesunate and mefloquine. Discussion and evaluation. DNDi undertook the development of a fixed-dose combination of artesunate with mefloquine. Partnerships were formed across five continents, addressing formulation, control and production through to clinical trials and product registration, resulting in a safe and efficacious fixed dose combination treatment which is now available to treat patients in resource-poor settings. The south-south technology transfer of production from Farmanguinhos/Fiocruz in Brazil to Cipla Ltd in India was the first of its kind. Of additional benefit was the increased capacity within the knowledge base and infrastructure in developing countries. Conclusions: This collaborative approach to drug development involving international partnerships and independent funding mechanisms is a powerful new way to develop drugs for tropical diseases. © 2013 Wells et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

2-s2.0-84874242822.xml,"The world's most successful intracellular bacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), survives inside macrophages by blocking phagosome maturation and establishes chronic infection characterized by the formation of granulomas. Trehalose-6,6-dimycolate (TDM), the mycobacterial cord factor, is the most abundant cell wall lipid of virulent mycobacteria, is sufficient to cause granuloma formation, and has long been known to be a major virulence factor of MTB. Recently, TDM has been shown to activate the Syk-Card9 signaling pathway in macrophages through binding to the C-type lectin receptor Mincle. The Mincle-Card9 pathway is required for activation of macrophages by TDM in vitro and for granuloma formation in vivo following injection of TDM. Whether this pathway is also exploited by MTB to reprogram the macrophage into a comfortable niche has not been explored yet. Several recent studies have investigated the phenotype of Mincle-deficient mice in mycobacterial infection, yielding divergent results in terms of a role for Mincle in host resistance.

Spherical and spheroidal model particles are employed to fit the aerosol optical properties and to retrieve information about the physical parameters characterising the aerosols. It is found that spherical particles are capable of reproducing the scalar optical properties and the forward peak of the phase function of the dust aerosols. The effective size parameter of the aerosol ensemble is retrieved with high accuracy by using spherical model particles. Significant improvements are achieved by using spheroidal model particles. The aerosol phase function and the other diagonal elements of the Stokes scattering matrix can be fitted with high accuracy, whereas the off-diagonal elements are poorly reproduced. More elongated prolate and more flattened oblate spheroids contribute disproportionately strongly to the optimised shape distribution of the model particles and appear to be particularly useful for achieving a good fit of the scattering matrix. However, the clear discrepancies between the shape distribution of the aerosols and the shape distribution of the spheroidal model particles suggest that the possibilities of extracting shape information from optical observations are rather limited. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The two major geological uncertainties that play a key role are related to the nature of parent statistical distributions of number and sizes of the fields in a given region of assessment. Statistical distributions of geological parameters can be estimated using Monte Carlo methods, taking care of the correlations, to produce field size distribution in the play or basin.

2-s2.0-84873961029.xml,"A number of secreted cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), are attractive targets for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We have determined the solution structure of mouse IL-6 to assess the functional significance of apparent differences in the receptor interaction sites (IL-6Rα and gp130) suggested by the fairly low degree of sequence similarity with human IL-6. Structure-based sequence alignment of mouse IL-6 and human IL-6 revealed surprising differences in the conservation of the two distinct gp130 binding sites (IIa and IIIa), which suggests a primacy for site III-mediated interactions in driving initial assembly of the IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 ternary complex. This is further supported by a series of direct binding experiments, which clearly demonstrate a high affinity IL-6/IL-6Rα-gp130 interaction via site III but only weak binding via site II. Collectively, our findings suggest a pathway for the evolution of the hexameric, IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 signaling complex and strategies for therapeutic targeting. We propose that the signaling complex originally involved specific interactions between IL-6 and IL-6Rα (site I) and between the D1 domain of gp130 and IL-6/IL-6Rα (site III), with the later inclusion of interactions between the D2 and D3 domains of gp130 and IL-6/IL-6Rα (site II) through serendipity. It seems likely that IL-6 signaling benefited from the evolution of a multipurpose, nonspecific protein interaction surface on gp130, now known as the cytokine binding homology region (site II contact surface), which fortuitously contributes to stabilization of the IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 signaling complex."

2-s2.0-84873911901.xml,"AIM: To study the coincidence of celiac disease, we tested its serological markers in patients with various liver diseases. METHODS: Large-scale screening of serum antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG), and deamidated gliadin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and serum antibodies against endomysium using immunohistochemistry, in patients with various liver diseases (n = 962) and patients who underwent liver transplantation (OLTx, n = 523) was performed. The expression of tTG in liver tissue samples of patients simultaneously suffering from celiac disease and from various liver diseases using immunohistochemistry was carried out. The final diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed by histological analysis of small-intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: We found that 29 of 962 patients (3%) with liver diseases and 5 of 523 patients (0.8%) who underwent OLTx were seropositive for IgA and IgG anti-tTG antibodies. However, celiac disease was biopsy-diagnosed in 16 patients: 4 with autoimmune hepatitis type I, 3 with Wilson's disease, 3 with celiac hepatitis, 2 with primary sclerosing cholangitis, 1 with primary biliary cirrhosis, 1 with Budd-Chiari syndrome, 1 with toxic hepatitis, and 1 with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Unexpectedly, the highest prevalence of celiac disease was found in patients with Wilson's disease (9.7%), with which it is only rarely associated. On the other hand, no OLTx patients were diagnosed with celiac disease in our study. A pilot study of the expression of tTG in liver tissue using immunohistochemistry documented the overexpression of this molecule in endothelial cells and periportal hepatocytes of patients simultaneously suffering from celiac disease and toxic hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis or autoimmune hepatitis type I.

The main lenses used are the participation in this migration by individuals as members of families, the informal recruitment mechanisms that bring new migrants on board, and the legal environment. The paper argues that the selection of a migrant by the family depends importantly on the costs of migration for the family, and shows how this consideration bears on the choice of women as seasonal migrants. In addition, the paper argues that the patterns of recruitment are gender-specific, explains why women recruit new migrants in a manner which differs from that of men, and assesses the impact of the underlying legal environment on the differential participation of women and men. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Different electrochemical couples of positive and negative materials have been subject of research and development, but only the nickel-cadmium system (NiCd) and, since about 10 years, the nickel-metal hydride system (NiMH) have achieved the stage of large volume production. Particularly, sealed NiCd and NiMH cells have been established in a variety of applications. Recent advances with the NiMH system have brought about portable batteries with energy storing capabilities coming close to those of alkaline primary cells. Although representing a technically interesting solution even for electric vehicles, relatively high cost will limit the use of rechargeable alkaline batteries to small high power batteries for hybrid electric vehicles.

2-s2.0-84874003568.xml,"Although ultraviolet A (UVA; 315-400 nm) has different physical and biological targets than ultraviolet B (UVB; 280-315 nm), the contribution of UVA to skin cancer susceptibility and its molecular basis remain largely unknown. Here we show that chronic UVA radiation suppresses phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression at the mRNA level. Subchronic and acute UVA radiation also downregulated PTEN in normal human epidermal keratinocytes, skin culture, and mouse skin. At the molecular level, chronic UVA radiation decreased the transcriptional activity of the PTEN promoter in a methylation-independent manner, whereas it had no effect on the protein stability or mRNA stability of PTEN. In contrast, we found that UVA-induced activation of the Ras/ERK/AKT and NF-k{cyrillic}B pathways plays an important role in UV-induced PTEN downregulation. Inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) or protein pinase B (AKT) increases PTEN expression. Our findings may provide unique insights into PTEN downregulation as a critical component of UVA's molecular impact during keratinocyte transformation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2-s2.0-84874248217.xml,"There are few previous studies on the elastic properties of ureter and most have been limited to essentially one-dimensional deformation measurements. The object of this study was, therefore, to identify regional variations in the multiaxial behaviour of rabbit ureter, subjected to in vitro inflation/extension testing under a physiological range of intraluminal pressures and longitudinal forces. A microstructure-motivated material model (via two- and four-fibre families in turn for elastin and collagen) was implemented and its capacity to mathematically characterise the experimental data contrasted favourably with that of the well-established phenomenological models, but it was compromised by parameter covariance. Extensive optimisation studies confirmed that the reduced model without contribution to the elastin and circumferential-fibre (collagen) families characterised the data equally well without over-parameterisation. In view of the fitted parameters, the ureteral tissue was stiffer longitudinally, justified by the preferential alignment of collagen along that axis and the lower ureter was stiffer than the upper ureter, justified by the histological observation of a thickest lamina propria, i.e. of highest collagen content, there. The lower ureter was less anisotropic than the upper ureter, possessing a comparatively larger amount of diagonally arranged collagen fibres in tunica mucosa, while having the usual amounts of longitudinally arranged fibres in tunica adventitia and of circumferentially arranged fibres in tunica muscularis. The present data may be used as inputs to mathematical models of the ureter, assessing regional and intramural stress distributions, through which it is hoped that an improved appreciation of ureteral function may be attained in both health and disease. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

When there is no associated pathology, however, the onset of age-related change is slow and of low impact. Change concerns the bones, muscles, mucosa, salivary glands, teeth, and the senses of smell and taste. As a consequence, the functions of mastication and swallowing are also altered. In geriatric dentistry age is not the only factor that should be taken into account, however, as other pathologies associated with ageing play an extremely important role. Many studies have reported correlation between oral health and certain other pathologies, or between oral health and mortality. Clear cause and effect relationships are difficult to establish, however, particularly in terms of dental status and nutrition. Decreased masticatory efficiency, particularly that associated with loss of teeth, compromises choice of food types and increases the risk of an unbalanced diet with its subsequent effect on general health. Knowledge and recognition of the evolution of oral function with age and its repercussions on general health, leads to a call for closer collaboration between physicians, nutritionists, geriatricians and dental surgeons."

The characterizations were constructed based on literature from the past decades. This part of the study is focusing on the model's ability to separate the mean state of the two species of the An. gambiae complex in Africa. The model is also evaluated with respect to capturing the temporal variability of An. arabiensis in Ethiopia. Before conclusions and guidance based on models can be made, models need to be validated. Methods. The model used in this paper is described in part one (Malaria Journal 2013, 12:28). For the validation of the model, a data base of 5,935 points on the presence of An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis was constructed. An additional 992 points were collected on the presence An. gambiae s.l. These data were used to assess if the model could recreate the spatial distribution of the two species. The dataset is made available in the public domain. This is followed by a case study from Madagascar where the model's ability to recreate the relative fraction of each species is investigated. In the last section the model's ability to reproduce the temporal variability of An. arabiensis in Ethiopia is tested. The model was compared with data from four papers, and one field survey covering two years. Results: Overall, the model has a realistic representation of seasonal and year to year variability in mosquito densities in Ethiopia. The model is also able to describe the distribution of An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis in sub-Saharan Africa. This implies this model can be used for seasonal and long term predictions of changes in the burden of malaria. Before models can be used to improving human health, or guide which interventions are to be applied where, there is a need to understand the system of interest. Validation is an important part of this process. It is also found that one of the main mechanisms separating An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis is the availability of hosts; humans and cattle.

Parallel documentation efforts can result in redundant or erroneous data and excess work. The introduction of hospital information systems (HIS) allows the implementation of digital oncological documentation systems integrated in surrounding clinical workflows that can provide access to existing data sources as well as data entry and presentation across departmental boundaries. This concept enables the integration of tumor documentation, quality assurance and process optimization within HIS. Feasibility requirements include a high flexibility and adaptability of the underlying HIS to reach a seamless integration of oncological documentation forms within routine clinical workflows.

2-s2.0-1642337952.xml,"When environments differentially influence male and female performance, environmental sex determination (ESD) might evolve. The conclusion from several previous theoretical models was that reaction norms for sex determination should have a single, sharp threshold, with only females being produced in some environments and only males in others. These reaction norms can be disadvantageous in fluctuating environments, however, because they lead to sex-ratio fluctuations. We analysed the evolution of ESD, looking for equilibrium strategies in unconstrained as well as constrained strategy spaces. We identified situations where a single-threshold reaction norm is not evolutionarily stable. In these cases, we found stable strategies in the form of complex reaction norms, showing an oscillatory pattern of sex determination with respect to variation in an environmental variable. Considering that constraints could prevent such phenotypes from being realized, we found that certain randomized reaction norms, with probabilistic sex determination for a range of environments, would achieve nearly the same fitness. We also investigated reaction norms constrained to have a single threshold and found that genetic polymorphism in the environmental threshold value could evolve, producing a similar effect as a randomized reaction norm. We argue that the appearance of genetic variation can be regarded as an alternative outcome when constraints prevent the evolution of a more complex or a randomized strategy. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Five-year survival between countries was compared for all malignancies and for the major diagnostic categories, adjusting for age, and estimated average European survival weighting for differences in childhood populations. Results: For all cancers combined, survival variation was large (45% in Estonia to 90% in Iceland), and was generally low (60-70%) in eastern Europe and high (≥75%) in Switzerland, Germany and the Nordic countries (except Denmark). The Nordic countries had the highest survival for four of the seven major tumour types: nephroblastoma (92%), acute lymphoid leukaemia (85%), CNS tumours (73%) and acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (62%). The eastern countries had lowest survival: 89% for Hodgkin's disease, 71% for nephroblastoma, 68% for acute lymphoid leukaemia, 61% for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 57% for central nervous system (CNS) tumours and 29% for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. Conclusions: The Nordic countries represent a survival gold standard to which other countries can aspire. Since most childhood cancers respond well to treatment, survival differences are attributable to differences in access (including referral and timely diagnosis) and use of modern treatments; however, the obstacles to access and application of standard treatments probably vary markedly with country. © 2003 European Society for Medical Oncology."

2-s2.0-1542315965.xml,"The inherent complexity of numerous industrial processes in the metallurgical industry poses formidable technical challenges for modeling, design and simulation: consequently, it is exceptionally difficult not only to optimize the operation of traditional plants without extensive experimentation, but also to model and analyze the feasibility and profitability of various novel designs proposed. Most metallurgical unit operations encompass a wide spectrum of phenomena (convection, diffusion, reaction, external field effects) that often occur simultaneously in multiphase configurations. Accurate modeling of complex distributed chemical processes entails the use of partial differential equation (PDE) descriptions which can now be routinely handled using commercial solvers; an attractive feature of the latter is a potential to handle combinations of diverse physical phenomena that occur in complex processes and yield highly coupled nonlinear PDE mathematical models. Thus, detailed steady state simulations of metallurgical processes can be obtained via advanced interactive software environments. A steady state sensitivity analysis of state variable distributions (namely, potential, absolute temperature and molten slag velocity) with respect to a key design variable (imposed electrode voltage) is performed for a conceptual carbothermic reduction reactor proposed by Johansen et al. (2000) for production of aluminium. Simultaneous solution of charge, heat and momentum balances on a suitably simplified two-dimensional computational domain representing a section of this reactor is used to achieve the goal of this work, which is to study trends important in efficient design. The major conclusion of the present CFD sensitivity study is that the voltage imposed on the horizontal heating electrode pairs affects the interplay between heat conduction and convection, thus the topography and uniformity of the temperature distribution. The electrode voltage has been qualitatively proved to govern the location and size of high-temperature regions in the reactor, thus affecting the advance of the quite endothermic carbothermic reduction reaction as well as the per volume reactor productivity. Therefore, electrode voltage is a crucial reactor design parameter that can also be used very conveniently as a manipulation variable for the efficient operation and control of a carbothermic reactor."

In four cases different types of abuse, than those suffered, arose. In five cases, several types of abuse were inflicted concomitantly. However, there was no statistically significant relation between the types of abuse suffered and those inflicted. Furthermore, 813 recording units (r.u. - which are basic codification units) were obtained in the content analysis, throughout the seven pre-categories (21 categories, 10 subcategories). The content analysis' categories Family Environment and Intra-family Relationships, were the ones with the highest number of r.u., and also the most disparate, when compared with the remaining categories (Family Environment = 218 r.u., Intra-family Relationships = 151 r.u.); being followed by Physical Abuse (87 r.u.) and Feelings towards the Perpetrator (58 r.u.). In opposition, the cate gories with the lowest number of r.u. were Sexual Abuse (1 r.u.) and Aggressor as Recognized Iden tification Figure (4 r.u.). Moreover, we also found differences between the participants who inflict Physical Abuse and those who are negligent, as Physical Abuse is transmitted in most cases while negligence is not. Differences were also found in the quality of the family environment, outside-family relationships and self-recognition as aggressors. A relation between excusing/exonerating the aggressor and feeling self-guilt for the abuse was found. Also, a relation between naming the aggressor as the identification figure and self-recognition as an aggressor was found in this sample. A principal component analysis was performed and the results evidenced that the context where the abuse occurs is better explained by a twodimension model, being the dimensions Maltreatment and Social Interactions and Abuse Context, Feelings and Perceptions. Strong associations were found between Psychological and Physical Abuse, Interpersonal Relationships, Feelings towards Abuse, and Toxic Habits/Con sump tions, or no apparent reason as causes for abuse; and between being the only victim of aggressions, perceiv ing other (not the aggressor) as an identification figure and negative feelings towards the aggressor. The transmission of abuse typologies was not statistically significant in this sample; however associations between contextual aspects were found and are discussed along with the limitations and implications of this study.

In total, 323 unique proteins were identified, covering 60% of the coding genes (323/547) in Chr.20. With regards to qualitative information of proteomics, we overall evaluated the correlation of the identified Chr.20 proteins with target genes of transcription factors or of microRNA, conserved genes and cancer-related genes. As for quantitative information, the expression abundances of Chr.20 genes were found to be almost consistent in both tissues and cell lines of mRNA in all individual chromosome regions, whereas those of Chr.20 proteins in cells are different from tissues, especially in the region of 20q13.33.

2-s2.0-1542376593.xml,"The classical quality management theory suggests that different quality improvement practices have a similar positive effect on overall operational efficiency, leading to customer satisfaction. Based on a study of 225 organizations in the electronics industry in Hong Kong, we find that individual quality improvement practice has a specific effect on operational performance, rather than equally improving the overall operational efficiency. Our investigations indicate that customer orientation practices primarily affect time-based efficiency, while process improvement efforts help cost-related performance. On the other hand, emphasizing process-control systems leads to customer satisfaction directly without necessarily improving operations. While supporting the basic assertions of the classical quality management theory, these findings reveal that several problems exist in the practice of quality management in industry, and suggest that a re-direction of several quality management practices seems necessary.

The mode of action of the Cry11 proteins has been described as similar to those of the Cry1 toxins, nevertheless, the mechanism of action is still not clear. In this study we investigated the in vivo binding of the Cry 11Bb toxin to the midgut of the insect species Anopheles albimanus, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus by immunohistochemical analysis. Spodoptera frugiperda was included as negative control. The Cry11Bb protein was detected on the apical microvilli of the midgut epithelial cells, mostly on the posterior midgut and gastric caeca of the three mosquito species. Additionally, the toxin was detected in the Malpighian tubules of An. albimanus, Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and in the basal membrane of the epithelial cells of Ae. aegypti midgut. No toxin accumulation was observed in the peritrophic membrane of any of the mosquito species studied. These results confirm that the primary site of action of the Cry11 toxins is the apical membrane of the midgut epithelial cells of mosquito larvae."

2-s2.0-84873915757.xml,"A number of disorders have been described to cause protein losing enteropathy (PLE) in children. Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) is one mechanism leading to PLE. Few syndromes are associated with PIL; Hennekam syndrome (HS) is one of them. The principal treatment for PIL is a high protein, low fat diet with medium chain triglycerides supplementation. Supportive therapy includes albumin infusion. Few publications have supported the use of octreotide to diminish protein loss and minimize hypoalbuminemia seen in PIL. There are no publications on the treatment of PIL with octreotide in patients with HS. We report two children with HS and PLE in which we used octreotide to decrease intestinal protein loss. In one patient, octreotide increased serum albumin to an acceptable level without further need for albumin infusions. The other patient responded more dramatically with near normal serum albumin levels and cessation of albumin infusions. In achieving a good response to octreotide in both patients, we add to the publications supporting the use of octreotide in PIL and suggest that octreotide should be tried in patients with PIL secondary to HS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on the use of octreotide in HSassociated PIL. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved."

High-resolution structural magnetic resonance images were taken in ten healthy controls and ten hypothyroid subjects. The analysis was conducted using statistical parametric mapping. The VBM study revealed a reduction in grey matter volume in the left postcentral gyrus and cerebellum of hypothyroid subjects compared to controls. A significant reduction in white matter volume was also found in the cerebellum, right inferior and middle frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, right inferior occipital gyrus and right temporal gyrus of hypothyroid patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, no meaningful cluster for greater grey or white matter volume was obtained in hypothyroid subjects compared to controls. Our study is the first VBM study of hypothyroidism in an adult population and suggests that, compared to controls, this disorder is associated with differences in brain morphology in areas corresponding to known functional deficits in attention, language, motor speed, visuospatial processing and memory in hypothyroidism. © 2012 British Society for Neuroendocrinology."

Specifically, the architecture of the proposed platform aims at being as modular and easily extensible as possible, in order to permit the inclusion of state-of-the-art techniques for the classification and retrieval of multimedia resources.

The masses of both components were derived with an accuracy better than 1 per cent, and their radii, with an accuracy better than 3 per cent. Since the primary's mass is equal to about 25M⊙, its radius was subsequently used to derive the age of the system which is equal to 4.3 ± 0.5Myr. The result shows that this method represents a viable alternative to isochrone fitting. A photometric search of the field of ALS 1135 resulted in the discovery of 17 variable stars, including 7 pulsating ones.

From March 1999 to March 2000, 67 hemodialysis patients (38 males, 29 females; median age: 52, range: 17-84) were evaluated. The CDC criteria were used to diagnose CESI, CR-BSI and CC. The tips of catheters were cultured by Maki's method. At the same time, two different blood cultures, one from peripheral vein and the other through the catheter lumen were drawn. Swab cultures from the catheter exit sites were also performed. The isolation and identification of bacteria were performed by conventional methods and the susceptibility testing by the Kirby-Bauer method. CESI, CR-BSI and CC were found in, respectively, 20 (29.8%), 16 (23.8%) and 11 (16.4%) patients. The etiologic agents in CR-BSI were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus (5), coagulase-negative staphylococci (2), Enterococcus sp. (1), Escherichia coli (1), Acinetobacter sp. (1) and Proteus sp. (1). Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were found in proportions of 45.5% and 63.6% in CESI and CR-BSI+CC.

Methods and Results: Altered diets through increasing concentrate/forage (50:50 vs 90:10) ratios and/or the addition of 6% soya oil were offered to steers and the Neocallimastigales community was assessed by PCR-based fingerprinting with specific primers within the barcode region. Both a decrease in fibre content and the addition of 6% soya oil affected Neocallimastigales diversity within solid and liquid rumen phases. The addition of 6% soya oil decreased species richness. Assemblages were strongly affected by the addition of 6% soya oil, whereas unexpectedly, the fibre decrease had less effect. Differences in volatile fatty acid contents (acetate, propionate and butyrate) were significantly associated with changes in Neocallimastigales assemblages between the treatments. Conclusions: Diet clearly influences Neocallimastigales assemblages. The data are interpreted in terms of interactions with other microbial groups involved in fermentation processes within the rumen.

However, conversely to adults, few studies have investigated cardiac output. Using transesophageal Doppler monitoring of cardiac output, we prospectively investigated hemodynamic alterations in 48 children (median age, 22.5 mo) receiving sevoflurane general anesthesia combined with caudal or thoracolumbar epidural anesthesia. They were randomly assigned to receive 0.8 mL/kg of plain local anesthetic mixture (lidocaine 1% + bupivacaine 0.25% (50/50) + 1 μg/mL of fentanyl) or 1 mL/kg of the same mixture with 5 μg/mL of adrenaline. No significant hemodynamic alteration was elicited in caudal and thoracolumbar groups receiving the plain mixture except a moderate decrease in heart rate. Conversely, a mixture with adrenaline added provoked a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure by 14% and 17%, in systemic vascular resistance by 24% and 40%, and an increase in cardiac output by 20% and 34% in caudal and thoracolumbar groups, respectively.

2-s2.0-84874104083.xml,"miRNAs (microRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that can regulate gene expression in cancer development, which makes them valuable targets for therapeutic intervention. In the present study we report on an approach that can not only arrest the functions of mature miRNAs by binding to them, but it can also induce the 'mis-processing' of the target miRNA, producing a non-functional truncated miRNA. This approach involves generating an expression construct that produces anRNA fragment with 16 repeat sequences. The construct is named miRPirate (miRNA-interacting RNA-producing imperfect RNA and tangling endogenous miRNA). The transcript of the construct contained mismatches to the seed region, and thus it would not target the potential targets of the miRNA under study. The homology of the construct is sufficiently high, allowing the transcript to block miRNA functions. The functions of the construct were validated in cell cultures, in tumour formation assays and in transgenic mice stably expressing this construct. To explore the possibility of adopting this approach in gene therapy, we transfected cells with synthetic miR-Pirate and obtained the results we expected. The miR-Pirate, expressed by the construct or synthesized chemically, was found to be able to specifically pirate and silence a mature miRNA through its dual roles and thus could be clinically applied for miRNA intervention. © 2013 Biochemical Society."

To determine the efficacy of biomedical risk assessment provided in addition to various levels of counselling, as a contributing aid to smoking cessation. For the most recent update, we searched the Cochrane Collaboration Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register in July 2012 for studies added since the last update in 2009. Inclusion criteria were: a randomized controlled trial design; subjects participating in smoking cessation interventions; interventions based on a biomedical test to increase motivation to quit; control groups receiving all other components of intervention; an outcome of smoking cessation rate at least six months after the start of the intervention. Two assessors independently conducted data extraction on each paper, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Results were expressed as a relative risk (RR) for smoking cessation with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, a pooled effect was estimated using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. We included 15 trials using a variety of biomedical tests. Two pairs of trials had sufficiently similar recruitment, setting and interventions to calculate a pooled effect; there was no evidence that carbon monoxide (CO) measurement in primary care (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32) or spirometry in primary care (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.81) increased cessation rates. We did not pool the other 11 trials due to the presence of substantial clinical heterogeneity. Of the remaining 11 trials, two trials detected statistically significant benefits: one trial in primary care detected a significant benefit of lung age feedback after spirometry (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.62) and one trial that used ultrasonography of carotid and femoral arteries and photographs of plaques detected a benefit (RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.04 to 7.41) but enrolled a population of light smokers and was judged to be at unclear risk of bias in two domains. Nine further trials did not detect significant effects. One of these tested CO feedback alone and CO combined with genetic susceptibility as two different interventions; none of the three possible comparisons detected significant effects. One trial used CO measurement, one used ultrasonography of carotid arteries and two tested for genetic markers. The four remaining trials used a combination of CO and spirometry feedback in different settings. There is little evidence about the effects of most types of biomedical tests for risk assessment on smoking cessation. Of the fifteen included studies, only two detected a significant effect of the intervention. Spirometry combined with an interpretation of the results in terms of 'lung age' had a significant effect in a single good quality trial but the evidence is not optimal. A trial of carotid plaque screening using ultrasound also detected a significant effect, but a second larger study of a similar feedback mechanism did not detect evidence of an effect. Only two pairs of studies were similar enough in terms of recruitment, setting, and intervention to allow meta-analyses; neither of these found evidence of an effect. Mixed quality evidence does not support the hypothesis that other types of biomedical risk assessment increase smoking cessation in comparison to standard treatment. There is insufficient evidence with which to evaluate the hypothesis that multiple types of assessment are more effective than single forms of assessment."

These pathological processes which evolve via different cell death mechanisms are discussed as a paradigm to apply MEA recording for detailed mapping of the functional damage and its time-dependent evolution. © 2013 Mladinic and Nistri."

The single-span reinforced concrete T-beam bridge population in Pennsylvania State is taken as a particular case study. First, a statistical analysis is conducted to examine implicit and explicit dependencies between various geometrical and structural parameters of the bridges, and the governing bridge parameters are identified along with their ranges of variation within the population. Then, a set of sample bridges are randomly generated using different combinations of the governing parameters within their predefined ranges of variation. An exact finite element analysis is implemented for each sample bridge, and the maximum moment and shear responses in beams are obtained at critical locations under various combinations of standard truck loads. An ANN is implemented to learn the relationship between the bridge parameters (inputs) and responses (outputs) based on the sample set and to make predictions for other bridges that are not present in the set. The performances of a variety of different ANN architectures are tested, and their prediction capabilities are measured and compared. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited."

Single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) and sequence analyses revealed four alleles (1-4), two of them being new allelic forms (3 and 4). Sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers AF549499-502. In alleles 1 and 4, potential transcription factor binding sites are altered by the mutations. Using SSCP analysis, all four alleles were identified in German Holsteins. Six intragenic haplotypes comprising CSN1S1-5′ (alleles 1, 2, 3, 4) and exon 17 (CSN1S1*B and C) genotypes were found. Linkage mapping using half-sib families from the German QTL project positioned CSN1S1 between the markers FBN14 and CSN3, with 5.6 cM distance between CSN1S1 and CSN3. Variance analysis, using family and CSN1S1 promoter genotypes as fixed effects, of breeding values and deregressed proofs for milk production traits (milk, fat, and protein yield and also fat and protein percentage) revealed significant effects on protein percentage when all families and genotypes were considered. Contrast calculations assigned a highly significant effect to genotype 24, which was associated with highest LS-means for protein percentage breeding values. As CSN1S1 is one of the main caseins in milk, this could be an effect of mutations in regulatory elements in the promoter region. An effect on milk yield breeding values was indicated for genotype 12, but is probably caused by a linked locus."

Methods: Using 1042 patients undergoing oesophageal (n = 538) or gastric (n = 504) surgery between 1994 and 2000 the Portsmouth predictor equation for mortality (P-POSSUM) scoring system was compared with a standard logistic regression O-POSSUM model and a multilevel O-POSSUM model using the following independent factors: age, physiological status, mode of surgery, type of surgery and histological stage. Results: The overall mortality rate was 12.0 per cent (elective mortality rate 9.4 per cent and emergency mortality rate 26.9 per cent). P-POSSUM overpredicted mortality (14.5 percent), particularly in the elective group of patients. The multilevel model offered higher discrimination than the single-level O-POSSUM and P-POSSUM models (area under receiver-operator characteristic curve 79.7 versus 74.6 and 74.3 per cent).

Here, we examined the effect of paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on appetitive responding for a preferred and an avoided taste solution using a progressive ratio (PR) task in which licking was employed as the operant. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8/taste stimulus) were trained to respond for a concentration series of sucrose or quinine on fixed and PR schedules of reinforcement. Performance for sucrose was assessed while the rats were partially food- and water-restricted and nondeprived, and performance for water and quinine was assessed while the rats were water-deprived. Then, the rats were injected with vehicle (10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1mL/kg intraperitoneal [ip], -1h) or paroxetine (5mg/kg), and their responding on a PR schedule for sucrose measured when the rats were nondeprived or for water and quinine when the rats were water-deprived. Paroxetine decreased breakpoint, which was defined as the number of operant (e.g., dry) licks in the final reinforced ratio, for water, quinine, and sucrose. This demonstrates that a general systemic increase in serotonergic activity decreases the appetitive-based responses to both preferred and nonpreferred fluids under different deprivation states. © The Author 2012.

Total quality management and TPM have significant similarities such that it can be ascertained that quality and success depend on the efforts of everyone within the organization. Therefore these two management philosophies of TQM and TPM can be analysed and compared. In looking at the similarities that show these philosophies are complementary, the paper reveals the possible reinforcement effects when they are integrated together in an SME.

Another area that continues to require attention is the development of accurate and efficient means to truncate the computational domain.

Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis revealed three main profile types (A, B and C) for parasites isolated from scallops. Sequence analysis revealed that samples represented by profiles B and C had a high degree (97.3%) of sequence similarity, whereas they were ∼21% different in sequence from those represented by profile A. These findings suggested that at least two types or species (represented by profile A, or profile B or C) of bucephalid infect scallops, of which both were detected in South Australia, while only one was found in Victoria. The prevalence of bucephalids (and their SSCP haplotypes) appeared to differ among the three species of scallop in South Australia as well as between the two scallop species in Victoria, indicating a degree of host specificity. Adult bucephalids were collected from Eastern Australian Salmon (Arripis trutta), in an attempt to match them with the asexual stages from the scallop hosts. Neither of the two taxa of adult bucephalid (Telorhynchus arripidis and an un-named Telorhynchus species) shared SSCP profiles with the bucephalids from scallops, but were genetically similar, suggesting that the asexual stages from scallops may represent the genus Telorhynchus. This study, which assessed nucleotide sequence variation in a portion of the mitochondrial cox1 gene for bucephalids found in scallops and arripid fish, illustrates the usefulness of the mutation scanning approach to elucidate complex life-cycles of marine parasites. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84873936621.xml,"AIM: To define which segments of the gastrointestinal tract are most likely to yield angioectasias for ablative therapy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for patients treated in the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Gastroenterology clinics between the dates of July 1, 2007 and October 1, 2010. The selection of cases for review was initiated by use of our electronic medical record to identify all patients with a diagnosis of angioectasia, angiodysplasia, or arteriovenous malformation. Of these cases, chart reviews identified patients who had a complete evaluation of their gastrointestinal tract as defined by at least one upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and small bowel capsule endoscopy within the past three years. Patients without evidence of overt gastrointestinal bleeding or iron deficiency anemia associated with intestinal angioectasias were classified as asymptomatic and excluded from this analysis. Thirty-five patients with confirmed, bleeding intestinal angioectasias who had undergone complete endoscopic evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: A total of 127 cases were reviewed. Sixtysix were excluded during subsequent screening due to lack of complete small bowel evaluation and/or lack of documentation of overt bleeding or iron deficiency anemia. The 61 remaining cases were carefully examined with independent review of endoscopic images as well as complete capsule endoscopy videos. This analysis excluded 26 additional cases due to insufficient records/ images for review, incomplete capsule examination, poor capsule visualization or lack of confirmation of typical angioectasias by the principal investigator on independent review. Thirty-five cases met criteria for final analysis. All study patients were age 50 years or older and 13 patients (37.1%) had chronic kidney disease stage 3 or higher. Twenty of 35 patients were taking aspirin (81 mg or 325 mg), clopidogrel, and/or warfarin, with 8/20 on combination therapy. The number and location of angioectasis was documented for each case. Lesions were then classified into the following segments of the gastrointestinal tract: esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, right colon and left colon. The location of lesions within the small bowel observed by capsule endoscopy was generally defined by percentage of total small bowel transit time with times of 0%-9%, 10%-39%, and 40%-100% corresponding to the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, respectively. Independent review of complete capsule studies allowed for deviation from this guideline if capsule passage was delayed in one or more segments. In addition, the location and number of angioectasias observed in the small bowel was further modified or confirmed by subsequent device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE) performed in the 83% of cases. In our study population, angioectasias were most commonly found in the jejunum (80%) followed by the duodenum (51%), stomach (22.8%), and right colon (11.4%). Only two patients were found to have angioectasias in the ileum (5.7%). Twenty-one patients (60%) had angioectasias in more than one location. CONCLUSION: Patients being considered for endoscopic ablation of symptomatic angioectasias should undergo push enteroscopy or anterograde DAE and reinspection of the right colon. © 2012 Baishideng.

Although these findings concern only a few families and sporadic cases, their potential importance is great, because these genes are implicated in a wide range of more common epileptic disorders and seizure types as well as some rare syndromes. Functional studies of these mutations, while leading to further progress in the neurobiology of the epilepsies, will help to refine genotype-phenotype relations and increase our understanding of responses to antiepileptic drugs.

Similar problems appear in non-SW developments with a strong reliance on a complex data model. Such problems include semantic drift and overload, and the provision of inaccurate or incomplete data.

Since it is difficult to quantify the number of judgment errors or accidents averted, metrics of success for fatigue management systems must be largely based on the accuracy of performance predictions derived from laboratory-based research studies and the extent to which such results can be generalized to the field environment. Performance metrics must, at a minimum, be correlated with occupational task performance to demonstrate relevance to real-world applications. This paper outlines broad goals for human effectiveness research related to fatigue, alertness, and performance.

We simulated a harvest in 6 randomly selected areas each year during November-January, 1997-2000, by trapping and removing 60% of bobwhites in each covey. We used flush counts and radiotelemetry to measure harvest effects on natural mortality rates, overall winter survival, covey size, and densities. Observed natural mortality rates of radiomarked individuals were similar between harvested (50.6 ± 4.3%) and unharvested areas (52.1 ± 4.7%). Estimated winter survival was 47.9% on the unharvested areas and 20.9% on the harvested areas. Harvest did not affect the number of coveys, average covey size, or density of bobwhites, indicating that coveys coalesced through local movement. Our results indicate that harvest is additive to natural mortality and suggest that local movement to maintain optimal group sizes can mask the true effect of harvest on observed densities in small areas."

2-s2.0-1542467453.xml,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate color Doppler ultrasonography in assessing hand collateral circulation before radial artery harvesting for coronary artery bypass grafting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hand circulation of 30 patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting was assessed by means of the modified Allen test and Doppler ultrasonography dynamic test. The test was performed by recording the flow in the superficial palmar branch of the radial and ulnar arteries with and without compression of the radial artery. In the postoperative period hemodynamic changes in the ulnar artery were also detected by means of Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: Among the 30 patients, one had abnormal and the other 29 had normal Doppler ultrasonography dynamic test results. All the patients' modified Allen test results were also normal. In 14 patients radial artery graft was used in the coronary artery bypass operation. CONCLUSION: Doppler ultrasonography dynamic test is an effective and noninvasive method in the preoperative evaluation of the hand collateral circulation for the safe removal of a radial artery graft."

The classification features we exploit are based on word frequencies in the text. We adopt an approach of preprocessing each text by stripping it of all characters except a-z and space. This is in order to increase the portability of the software to different types of texts. We test the methodology on a corpus of undisputed English texts, and use leave-one-out cross validation to demonstrate classification accuracies in excess of 90%.

From the transmission data, the effective permittivity, permeability and refractive index are calculated. In the pass band, we found that the real part of permeability and both the real and the imaginary part of the permittivity are negative. Transmission data for some new structures are also shown.

2-s2.0-84873959605.xml,"Background: The human ERBB2 gene is frequently amplified in breast tumors, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis. We previously reported a significant inverse correlation between Myc promoter-binding protein-1 (MBP-1) and ERBB2 expression in primary breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). MBP-1 is a transcriptional repressor of the c-MYC gene that acts by binding to the P2 promoter; only one other direct target of MBP-1, the COX2 gene, has been identified so far.Methods: To gain new insights into the functional relationship linking MBP-1 and ERBB2 in breast cancer, we have investigated the effects of MBP-1 expression on endogenous ERBB2 transcript and protein levels, as well as on transcription promoter activity, by transient-transfection of SKBr3 cells. Reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to dissect the ERBB2 promoter and identify functional MBP-1 target sequences. We also investigated the relative expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 in IDC and normal breast tissues by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry.Results: Transfection experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in SKBr3 cells indicated that MBP-1 negatively regulates the ERBB2 gene by binding to a genomic region between nucleotide -514 and -262 of the proximal promoter; consistent with this, a concomitant recruitment of HDAC1 and loss of acetylated histone H4 was observed. In addition, we found high expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 in normal tissues and a statistically significant inverse correlation with ErbB2 expression in the paired tumor samples.Conclusions: Altogether, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the ERBB2 gene is a novel MBP-1 target, and immunohistochemistry analysis of primary tumors suggests that the concomitant high expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 may be considered a diagnostic marker of cancer progression for breast IDC. © 2013 Contino et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

To estimate the real costs of allogeneic haematopoetic stem-cell transplantation and to compare these with the historically determined budgets that are made available for this purpose (€ 70,038 for genetically related donors and € 76,826 for unrelated donors). Design. Cost analysis. Methods. In the period 1994-1999, the direct medical costs (price level of 1998) of bone-marrow transplantation from related donors (BMT), stem-cell transplantation from unrelated donors (VUD-SCT) and allogeneic peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) from related donors were determined on the basis of data on adult patients with either acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 66) or acute lymphocytic leukaemia (n = 31). First, the medical resource use by these patients was determined and multiplied by the unit costs of each of the items. Second, a structural programme for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation brings along costs that are not evident from the registration of the medical resource use (e.g., the costs of pre-transplantation screening and the selection of the donor). The costs of these items were calculated by taking inventory in the hospitals and assessed by experts. Results. The average costs per transplanted patient were € 98,334 (BMT), € 151,754 (VUD-SCT) and € 98,977 (PBSCT) during the first two years after transplantation. The greater part of the costs was incurred in the transplantation phase. In VUD-SCT, one-third of the total cost was due to the costs of finding a suitable donor."

However, this procedure that includes data collection, periodical observations, and multivariate risk assessment analysis is difficult to accomplish with the traditional practices and methods since it is time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, many archaeological sites and monuments are located at inaccessible areas, far away from the main road network and urban areas. Satellite remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can successfully confront this problem by providing the scientists with integrated monitoring of the study areas and the unique advantage to store and manipulate a large amount of spatial and attribute data simultaneously. Actually the monitoring and identification of several natural and anthropogenic hazards in the vicinity of the cultural heritage sites in Cyprus, seems to be one of the main priorities of its governmental and municipal authorities. This study aims to integrate both satellite remote sensing techniques and GIS in a multidisciplinary approach, for monitoring anthropogenic and natural hazards with the use of archived and up-to-date multitemporal remotely sensed images in the study area, namely in areas nearby cultural heritage sites and monuments in Cyprus.

2-s2.0-1642377054.xml,"A serious crisis is identified in theories of neurocomputation, marked by a persistent disparity between the phenomenological or experiential account of visual perception and the neurophysiological level of description of the visual system. In particular, conventional concepts of neural processing offer no explanation for the holistic global aspects of perception identified by Gestalt theory. The problem is paradigmatic and can be traced to contemporary concepts of the functional role of the neural cell, known as the Neuron Doctrine. In the absence of an alternative neurophysiologically plausible model, I propose a perceptual modeling approach, to model the percept as experienced subjectively, rather than modeling the objective neurophysiological state of the visual system that supposedly subserves that experience. A Gestalt Bubble model is presented to demonstrate how the elusive Gestalt principles of emergence, reification, and invariance can be expressed in a quantitative model of the subjective experience of visual consciousness. That model in turn reveals a unique computational strategy underlying visual processing, which is unlike any algorithm devised by man, and certainly unlike the atomistic feed-forward model of neurocomputation offered by the Neuron Doctrine paradigm. The perceptual modeling approach reveals the primary function of perception as that of generating a fully spatial virtual-reality replica of the external world in an internal representation.

Expert opinion from sociolinguistics, however, contends that such a view is the result of middle-class bias and cannot be scientifically justified. In the 1960s and 1970s, such luminaries as Labov and Trudgill were at pains to point out to educationalists, with some success, that this 'deficit' view of working-class children's communicative competence is not a helpful one. However, a close reading of recent think-tank reports and policy papers on language and literacy teaching in schools reveals that the linguistic deficit hypothesis has resurfaced and is likely to influence present-day educational policy and practice. In this paper, I examine in detail the findings, claims and recommendations of the reports and argue that they are biased, poorly researched and reflect the vested interests of certain specialist groups.

2-s2.0-1642393306.xml,"Background: In a great many situations within health care and treatment, children are subjected to unnecessary pain and suffering. When local anaesthetics is to be administered the child can experience this as incomprehensible especially when the nursing staff assures the child that no pain would be felt, only to discover soon after, that it actually did hurt at the moment of anaesthetic infiltration. The soothing of pain during the suturing of wounds in emergency wards can be reduced, ensuring that unnecessary pain in the cafe-and-treatment process is mot meted out to children. In order to prevent this (subjection to unnecessary pain), and by improving accepted practice, it was interesting to investigate whether children felt pain at the time of infiltration anaesthesia following the initial topical anaesthesia. Aim: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of introductory topical anaesthesia using Xylocain solution dropped in the wound prior to a definitive infiltration-anaesthesia. An experimental, prospective design was used where children were included in either an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group (n=10) were given a Xylocain solution while the control group (n=10) received physiological Sodium solution. Data collection for the study was made by making VAS estimates and by interviews. Result: The study shows that a certain alleviation of pain does occur when using Xylocain but no statistically significant difference exists between the two groups. Irrespective of whether the children received an introductory topical anaesthesia with Xylocain or Sodium solution at the time of infiltration anaesthesia, they expressed pain in connection with infiltration. The study also shows that many children express fear and anxiety. Conclusion: Current research highlights the difficulties involved in offering children a really satisfactory form of pain relief in connection with infiltration anaesthesia and suturing of wounds. It is urgent to throw more light on children's pain, both from a nursing and from a medical point of view. No statistically significant difference was found in children's reported pain, after treatment with Xylocain but the solution can have a positive effect at the time of the infiltration jab, but a larger study needs to be done in order to establish this firmly. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84874026645.xml,"We propose a new approach to compute correlators of quantum fields in de Sitter space. It is based on nonequilibrium field theory techniques, and exploits de Sitter symmetries so as to partially reduce the number of independent variables of n-point functions in a manner that preserves the usefulness of a momentum representation, e.g., for writing spatial convolution integrals as simple products. In this representation, the two-point function of a scalar field only depends on two physical momenta, and the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson evolution equations take the form of momentum flow equations. Moreover, standard diagrammatic rules can be entirely formulated in this representation. The method is suitable for analytical approximations as well as numerical implementations.

The geography of science and animal geography literatures have broadly examined, respectively but with overlap, the social construction of scientific knowledge and ideas about animal subjectivity. This article argues that these literatures should be further employed to better understand the current construction and social negotiation of the concept of farm animal welfare in Europe and particularly in the US, specifically through the exploration of three significant spaces of knowledge production: the geopolitical environments of the US and Europe, the particular scientific research spaces, and animal spaces or the ""locations"" of their subjectivity. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
2-s2.0-84874114384.xml,"The pressure on reducing environmental footprint is facilitating the emergence of energy supply chains that have biomass as main feedstock. For the development of efficient energy supply chains from biomass it is required to properly integrate the various elements that comprise such systems (e.g., biomass supply, pre-treatment facilities and technologies for biomass to energy and/or fuels conversion). Additionally, it is recognised that a concerted effort is required, embracing the different supply chain entities, in order to correctly estimate environmental burdens and to propose effective environmental strategies. This chapter proposes the use of a mathematical modelling approach as an analytical tool that can support decision-making towards accomplishing the design and planning of efficient multiple source-multiple product bio-energy supply chains. The mathematical formulation of this problem becomes a multi-objective MILP (moMILP). Criteria selected for the objective function are the net present value (NPV) and the overall environmental impact, which is computed using the Impact 2002+ indicator. The main advantages of this approach are highlighted through a case study of a biomass-based supply chain that comprises different components geographically distributed over Spain.

Those in the intervention condition (N = 8) received one daily text message underpinned by TPB constructs: Attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intention. Those in the control condition (N = 10) received weekly general health messages. Self-reported insulin administration was the main outcome measure; conscientiousness and consideration of future consequences (CFC) were measured as potential moderators. Analyses of covariance revealed no main effects of condition for morning and afternoon injections but a marginally significant effect for evening injections (p =.08). This main effect was qualified by significant interactions of condition with conscientiousness (p =.001), CFC (p =.007) and a three-way interaction among condition, conscientiousness and CFC (p =.009). Exploration of the interactions indicated the intervention significantly improved evening injection rates only in the low conscientiousness and low CFC groups. This effect was particularly strong among those low in both conscientiousness and CFC.

2-s2.0-84873987701.xml,"Measurement of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) is the conventional non-invasive method for assessment of endothelial function; however, it requires an expensive ultrasound system and high levels of technical skill. Therefore, we developed a novel method for measurement of endothelial function, namely, measurement of ezFMD. ezFMD estimates the degree of vasodilatation from the oscillation signals transmitted to a sphygmomanometer cuff attached to the upper arm. The objective of this study was to validate the principle underlying the measurement of ezFMD, and to evaluate the repeatability of the ezFMD measurements. We observed the blood vessel behavior and oscillometric pattern in ten subjects. When the cuff was inflated to the level of the mean blood pressure, the oscillation amplitude increased with increasing degree of vasodilatation. In experiment to evaluate the repeatability of the ezFMD measurement, the average difference between the paired measurements was 3.7 %, the standard deviation was 11.5 %, and the average coefficient of variation value for the 11 paired measurements was 23.7 %. These results suggest the validity of the principle underlying the measurement of the ezFMD for the assessment of endothelial function. And, this study suggests that the repeatability of the ezFMD measurements is superior to that of the conventional measurement of FMD. © 2012 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering."

Design/methodology/approach - A review of the literature identified four determinants of customer loyalty which were used to survey 624 students from five universities in Ghana. Data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis and multiple regression. Findings - The study found satisfaction with bank services, image of the bank, availability of electronic bank services and perceived service quality as the determinants of students' bank loyalty. Perceived service quality was, however, not significant in predicting students' loyalty to their banks. Practical implications - The study highlights the importance of understanding students' behavior with regard to banking services. The three factors identified as significant predictors of students' loyalty could be used by retail banks to design effective marketing strategies to attract and retain the student cohort in Ghana. Originality/value - The study was the first of its kind that investigates students' loyalty in retail banks in sub-Saharan Africa.

2-s2.0-84873988023.xml,"Intestinal injuries are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality arising from trauma to the abdomen. The biomechanical characterisation of the small intestine allows for the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for these injuries. Studies reported in the literature focus principally on quasi-static tests, which do not take into account the stresses experienced during high kinetic trauma. In addition, the use of embalmed human tissue can alter the recorded response. The stress-strain curves from 43 tensile tests performed at 1 m/s were analysed. Samples were prepared from four fresh human intestines and from four embalmed cadaveric intestines. The data indicated a two-phase response, with each response consisting of a quasi-linear increase in the stress followed by an inflection in the curve before a peak preceding the loss of stress. The fresh tissue was more deformable than the embalmed tissue, and its first peak stress was lower (P = 0.034). A complementary histological analysis was performed.

Materials and methods: 81 diaries in 16 patients (up to 8 years) were assessed, by a specific scoring system, regarding incontinence and evacuation. In the overall series and in three postoperative time groups, the correlation between the two items, their mean scores and relative score rates (% of the maximum possible scoring) were calculated. Results: The Spearman correlation coefficient in all assessments was -0.128. According to timing, it was: 0.468 (short term), -0.036 (mean term) and -0.69 (long term). Incontinence was more disabling than evacuation; constipation occurred more frequently. Incontinence improved over time; constipation did not substantially change. Conclusions: Current criteria for functional assessment do not describe the true conditions after TAR and their variations over time. Profound consideration is necessary before announcing ultimate judgements on TAR."
2-s2.0-84874114675.xml,Novel machine-learning and feature-selection algorithms have been developed to study: i) the flare-prediction-capability of magnetic feature (MF) properties generated by the recently developed Solar Monitor Active Region Tracker (SMART); ii) SMART's MF properties that are most significantly related to flare occurrence. Spatiotemporal association algorithms are developed to associate MFs with flares from April 1996 to December 2010 in order to differentiate flaring and non-flaring MFs and enable the application of machine-learning and feature-selection algorithms. A machine-learning algorithm is applied to the associated datasets to determine the flare-prediction-capability of all 21 SMART MF properties. The prediction performance is assessed using standard forecast-verification measures and compared with the prediction measures of one of the standard technologies for flare-prediction that is also based on machine-learning: Automated Solar Activity Prediction (ASAP). The comparison shows that the combination of SMART MFs with machine-learning has the potential to achieve more accurate flare-prediction than ASAP. Feature-selection algorithms are then applied to determine the MF properties that are most related to flare occurrence. It is found that a reduced set of six MF properties can achieve a similar degree of prediction accuracy as the full set of 21 SMART MF properties. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The most important amino sugars in soil are glucosamine, galactosamine, muramic acid, and mannosamine. A method was developed for the simultaneous determination of these four amino sugars by high-performance reverse-phase liquid chromatography in standard solutions, soil and root hydrolysates. Pre-column derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) was used in an automated sample injector with thermostatic regulation of the reagent at 4°C. The separation of the four amino sugars was fully satisfactory and was not disturbed by other fluorescent components in the soil and root hydrolysates."

Aggressive immunosuppressive therapy with systemic corticosteroids and immunoglobulins resulted in complete remission of lupus, and a prompt clinical and radiological regression of hyperplastic gastropathy. Hyperplastic gastropathy is an uncommon gastric illness, which is usually idiopathic but rarely is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, cytomegalovirus infection or lymphocytic gastritis. Three previous case reports have noted a response of idiopathic hyperplastic gastropathy to systemic corticosteroid treatment, yet none of the presented patients had a systemic inflammatory disease. The presented case is the first in the medical literature in which hyperplastic gastropathy is directly linked to the development of clinical and laboratory manifestations of SLE. We suggest that hyperplastic gastropathy be added to the list of rare gastrointestinal manifestations of SLE, and that autoimmune disease be considered a possible cause of hyperplastic gastropathy. As such, any patient with symptomatic idiopathic hyperplastic gastropathy accompanied by other evidence of systemic inflammation should be considered for SLE evaluation and immunosuppressive treatment."

Most OF sensing robots developed so far have used numerically complex algorithms requiring large computational power often carried out offline. The present study shows the performances of our bio-inspired Visual Motion Sensor (VMS) based on a 3×4 matrix of auto-adaptive aVLSI photoreceptors pertaining to a custom-made bio-inspired chip called APIS (Adaptive Pixels for Insect-based Sensors). To achieve such processing with the limited computational power of a tiny microcontroller (μC), the μC-based implementation of the 'time of travel' scheme requiring at least a 1kHz sampling rate was modified by linearly interpolating the photoreceptors signals to run the algorithm at a lower sampling rate. The accuracy of the measurements was assessed for various sampling rates in simulation and the best tradeoff between computational load and accuracy determined at 200Hz was implemented onboard a tiny μC. By interpolating the photoreceptors signals and by fusing the output of several Local Motion Sensors (LMSs), we ended up with an accurate and frequently refreshed VMS measuring a visual angular speed and requiring more than 4 times less computational resources. © 2012 IEEE."

The lack of tactile feedback in the currently available endoscopic and robotic telemanipulation systems however represents a significant limitation. A need has arisen for the development of surgical instruments having integrated sensors. Current efforts to integrate sensors into or onto surgical tools has focused on fabrication of sensors on silicon, polyimide, or some other substrate and then attaching the sensors to a tool by hand or machine with epoxy, tape, or some other glue layer. Attaching the sensor in this manner has certain deficiencies. In particular, this method of attaching sensors to a surgical tool limits the sensors size, increases its thickness, and further constrains where the sensor can be placed. A method of fabricating tactile sensors on surgical instruments that addresses these deficiencies is discussed."

2-s2.0-84873917190.xml,"A 57-year-old man presented with a 2-wk history of painless jaundice and weight loss. He had a large illdefined enhancing mass-like lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas with stricture of the distal common bile duct. Aspiration cytology of the pancreatic mass demonstrated inflammatory cells without evidence of malignancy. Total serum immunoglobulin G level was slightly elevated, but IgG4 level was normal. After the 2-wk 40 mg prednisolone trial, the patient's symptoms and bilirubin level improved significantly. A follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan showed a dramatic resolution of the pancreatic lesion. A low dose steroid was continued. After six months he self-discontinued prednisolone for 3 wk, and was presented with jaundice again. A CT scan showed newly developed intrahepatic biliary dilatation and marked concentric wall thickening of the common hepatic duct and the proximal common bile duct without pancreatic aggravation. The patient' s IgG4 level was elevated to 2.51 g/L. Prednisolone was started again, after which his serum bilirubin level became normal and the thickening of the bile duct was resolved. This case suggests that autoimmune pancreatitis can progress to other organs that are not involved at the initial diagnosis, even with sustained pancreatic remission. © 2012 Baishideng.

2-s2.0-84873908678.xml,"AIM: To investigate the protective effect and mechanisms of ghrelin postconditioning against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced injury in human gastric epithelial cells. METHODS: The model of H/R injury was established in gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1) human gastric epithelial cells. Cells were divided into seven groups: normal control group (N); H/R postconditioning group; DMSO postconditioning group (DM); ghrelin postconditioning group (GH); D-Lys3-GHRP-6 + ghrelin postconditioning group (D + GH); capsazepine + ghrelin postconditioning group (C + GH); and LY294002 + ghrelin postconditioning group (L + GH). 3-(4,5-dimethylthazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to detect GES-1 cell viability. Hoechst 33258 fluorochrome staining and flow cytometry were conducted to determine apoptosis of GES-1 cells. Spectrophotometry was performed to determine release of lactate dehydrogenate (LDH). Protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β was determined by western blotting. Expression of vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1), Akt and GSK-3β was observed by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the H/R group, cell viability of the GH group was significantly increased in a dosedependent manner (55.9% ± 10.0% vs 69.6% ± 9.6%, 71.9% ± 17.4%, and 76.3% ± 13.3%). Compared with the H/R group, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the GH group significantly decreased (12.38% ± 1.51% vs 6.88% ± 0.87%). Compared with the GH group, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the D + GH group, C + GH group and L + GH groups significantly increased (11.70% ± 0.88%, 11.93% ± 0.96%, 10.20% ± 1.05% vs 6.88% ± 0.87%). There were no significant differences in the percentage of apoptotic cells between the H/R and DM groups (12.38% ± 1.51% vs 13.00% ± 1.13%). There was a significant decrease in LDH release following ghrelin postconditioning compared with the H/R group (561.58 ± 64.01 U/L vs 1062.45 ± 105.29 U/L). There was a significant increase in LDH release in the D + GH, C + GH and L + GH groups compared with the GH group (816.89 ± 94.87 U/L, 870.95 ± 64.06 U/L, 838.62 ± 118.45 U/L vs 561.58 ± 64.01 U/L). There were no significant differences in LDH release between the H/R and DM groups (1062.45 ± 105.29 U/L vs 1017.65 ± 68.90 U/L). Compared with the H/R group, expression of Bcl-2 and Akt increased in the GH group, whereas expression of Bax and GSK- 3β decreased. Compared with the GH group, expression of Bcl-2 decreased and Bax increased in the D + GH, C + GH and L + GH groups, and Akt decreased and GSK-3β increased in the L + GH group. The H/R group also upregulated expression of VR1 and GSK-3β and downregulated Akt. The number of VR1-positive and Akt-positive cells in the GH group significantly increased, whereas the number of GSK-3β-positive cells significantly decreased. These effects of ghrelin were reversed by capsazepine and LY294002. CONCLUSION: Ghrelin postconditioning protected against H/R-induced injury in human gastric epithelial cells, which indicated that this protection might be associated with GHS-R, VR1 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. © 2012 Baishideng.

Little or no postdrier checking occurred in spaghetti made from semolina or spaghetti containing buckwheat bran flour when dried at high (70°C) or ultrahigh temperature (90°C). When dried at low temperature (40°C), tolerance to postdrier checking of spaghetti decreased as buckwheat bran flour increased 0-30% (w/w). Hydration level before extrusion did not affect cooking loss of spaghetti made from semolina. However, cooking loss was greater from spaghetti made with semolina-buckwheat bran flour that was hydrated to 32% compared with 29-31% absorption. Cooked firmness of spaghetti containing buckwheat bran flour decreased from 0.588-0.471 Nm as hydration increased from 29-32% absorption.

2-s2.0-84874096152.xml,"The early 21st century has witnessed a steady push by scientists, industry leaders, and government officials to make medicine more personalized. To date, the concept of personalized medicine has referred largely to the field of pharmacogenomics. In contrast, relatively few data exist regarding the application of preventive strategies such as physical exercise in the context of personalized medicine. Within this review, we highlight the extant literature and propose five strategies for scientists that may propel the exercise and sports science fields toward this global goal. Notably, these approaches are in addition to methods to maintain adherence to training - a well-known factor in determining exercise responsiveness. Briefly, these strategies include (1) evaluating participant responses to training at the individual as well as group level; (2) identifying sources of variability in responsiveness to training; (3) optimizing exercise dosing strategies to maximize benefits while minimizing barriers to participation; (4) evaluating the efficacy of multimodal interventions for relevant population subgroups; and (5) increasing the clinical relevance of study populations and outcomes in exercise trials. We look forward to seeing these strategies considered in trials of preventive health interventions such as exercise. Extensive future research in this area is needed for the vision of exercise as a personalized form of medicine to become a reality. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

In daily clinical routine, systemic chemotherapy is still considered the only reasonable therapy despite of encouraging results of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) along with intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (HIPEC). The Achilles heel of CRS and HIPEC is appropriate patient selection and precise surgical technique preventing patients from excessive morbidity and mortality. Given these findings, new concepts of second look surgery for high risk patients allow detection of peritoneal spread ahead of clinical symptoms or presence of peritoneal masses reducing perioperative morbidity. In addition, personalized intraperitoneal chemotherapy might further improve outcome by appreciating individual tumor biology. These days, every physician should be aware of CRS and HIPEC for treatment of peritoneal surface malignancies. Since there is now sufficient data for the superiority of CRS and HIPEC to systemic chemotherapy in selected patients, our next goal should be providing this strategy with minimal morbidity and mortality even in the presence of higher tumor load. © 2012 Baishideng.

Existing conceptual research relating to interorganizational relationships and networks is reviewed in terms of its relevance to understanding supply networks; this research is drawn from the fields of strategic management, channel management, industrial marketing and purchasing, organizational behaviour and supply-chain management. The different perspectives each field has on networks are highlighted. Contributions made by each in assisting to understand supply networks are discussed and synthesized. Findings from an exploratory survey are used to structure the design of a conceptual model for analysing the processes involved in the creation and operation of supply networks. The authors identify nine different types of networking activities and discuss the nature of these activities in the context of supply. Four different types of contextual factors relating to supply networks are identified. The model is tested in eight in-depth case studies and a validating survey of 58 focal firm networks.

2-s2.0-84873987431.xml,"The paper describes findings from an ethnographic study exploring understandings of love and intimacy amongst young heterosexual middle-class Indians of Gujarati origin in the UK and India. A two-site comparative study was used to enable an understanding of how social and economic contexts shape cultural constructions of intimate relationships and sexuality. Focusing on attitudes to 'love at first sight', this paper shows that, for Indian participants, love based on physical attraction denotes a lesser kind of love. A relationship based on 'physical love' is not expected to last, since it has been formed without regard to family and status concerns. Even couples who meet outside of the arranged marriage system demonstrate the quality of their love by not having sex with one another before marriage. In the UK, however, participants view love as properly spontaneous. Love at first sight is considered desirable and demonstrates how the relationship must be based on love only, without any concern for (for example) material gain. This spontaneous love entails both physical attraction and emotional connection - an early transition to sex, usually before marriage, was seen as both desirable and inevitable. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

The aim of the present work was to use a multidimensional approach to (a) analyze the factor structure of an aesthetic experience and (b) to construct the Art Reception Survey (ARS) to validly measure these factors. In Study 1, 193 participants rated different art paintings of various styles and artists with a set of 76 items describing various components of an aesthetic experience. Principal component analysis revealed a six-factor structure including the recipient's cognitive involvement, his or her positive and negative affective appraisal, self-referential aspects, judgments about the artistic quality and creativity, as well as information about the knowledge and comprehension the recipient has about the artwork. Furthermore, we examined the specificity of the ARS scales for art stimuli by comparing the questionnaire between art and nonart stimuli (Study 2). The results of both studies indicate adequate reliability and validity of the instrument.

2-s2.0-1642263722.xml,"Oxidative folding is a composite process that consists of both the conformational folding to the native three-dimensional structure and the regeneration of the native disulfide bonds of a protein, frequently involving over 100 disulfide intermediate species. Understanding the oxidative folding pathways of a multiple-disulfide-containing protein is a very difficult task that often requires years of devoted research due to the high complexity of the process and the very similar features of the large number of intermediates. Here we developed a method for rapidly delineating the major features of the oxidative folding pathways of a protein. The method examines the temperature dependence of the oxidative folding rate of the protein in combination with reduction pulses. Reduction pulses expose the presence of structured intermediates along the pathways. The correlation between the regeneration rate at different temperatures and the stability of the structured intermediates reveals the role that the intermediates play in determining the pathway. The method was first tested with bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A whose folding pathways were defined earlier. Then, it was explored to discern some of the major features of the folding pathways of its homologue, frog Onconase. The results suggest that the stability of the three-dimensional structure of the native protein is a major determinant of the folding rate in oxidative folding.

2-s2.0-84873915118.xml,"Perhaps ""the"" question in this age of workplace technological Innovation concerns the amount of privacy employees should have in electronic locations in the workplace.An important related question is whether public-sector and private-sector employees, who have different legal statuses under the State action doctrine, should enjoy the same level of workplace privacy.Recently, in the Fourth Amendment workplace privacy case of City of Ontario v.Quon, the United States Supreme Court considered both of these questions.Quon involved alleged privacy violations by a city police department when it audited an ojficer's text messages from his city-issued pager.In a cryptic decision, fustice Kennedy held for a unanimous Court that assuming the officer had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the pager, the City's search of the pager was reasonable under two possible legal tests.First, under the plurality test enunciated by the Supreme Court in O'Connor v.Ortega, it was reasonable because it was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose and was not excessive in scope.Second, under the test outlined by fustice Scalia in his concurring opinion in O'Connor, it was reasonable because it would be considered ""reasonable and normal"" in the private-sector workplace.To varying degrees, both of these legal tests suggest that questions of workplace privacy in the public and private sectors should be treated the same.Rather than elevating private-sector privacy rights to the public-sector level, however, Quon suggests that public employee workplace privacy rights should be reduced to the level of employees in the private sector.Maintaining that public-sector workers are entitled to greater levels of privacy Protections based on the text of the Constitution, the power of the government as employer, and the critical oversight wie public employees play in American democracy, this Article argues for a new, two-step workplace privacy analysis which first focuses on the purpose of the search and then applies presumptively the Fourth Amendment's Warrant and probable cause requirements to those searches undertaken for investigatory purposes.© 2012 Paul M.Secunda."
2-s2.0-84873973104.xml,"Predictions computed by a classification tree are usually constant on axis-parallel hyperrectangles corresponding to the leaves and have strict jumps on their boundaries. The density function of the underlying class distribution may be continuous and the gradient vector may not be parallel to any of the axes. In these cases a better approximation may be expected, if the prediction function of the original tree is replaced by a more complex continuous approximation. The approximation is constructed using the same training data on which the original tree was grown and the structure of the tree is preserved. The current paper uses the model of trees with soft splits suggested by Quinlan and implemented in C4-5, however, the training algorithm is substantially different. The method uses simulated annealing, so it is quite computationally expensive. However, this allows to adjust the soft thresholds in groups of the nodes simultaneously in a way that better captures interactions between several predictors than the original approach. Our numerical test with data derived from an experiment in particle physics shows that besides the expected better approximation of the training data, also smaller generalization error is achieved."

2-s2.0-84874109638.xml,"Hyperglycemia in the inpatient setting is associated with poor clinical outcomes and is often suboptimally managed. This review addresses the pathophysiology of hyperglycemia, current recommendations for management of inpatient hyperglycemia in the general medical and surgical care setting, the transition between different diabetes treatments, and the transition from inpatient to outpatient therapy. The preferred drug for management of inpatient hyperglycemia is insulin. Successful use of intravenous and subcutaneous insulin in the hospital is based on the implementation of standardized protocols. Current guidelines recommend basal-bolus subcutaneous insulin in non-critically ill patients. The methods of switching from intravenous to subcutaneous, sliding-scale to basal-bolus, and biphasic to basal-bolus are discussed. Transition from an inpatient to an outpatient insulin regimen, especially in patients new to insulin therapy, requires special attention to ensure that patients have the knowledge to administer insulin safely and effectively. The optimal regimen at discharge must be individualized. Patients with acute infections may benefit from insulin therapy until the infection is resolved. Strategies to optimize diabetes therapy after discharge are discussed. Prompt outpatient follow-up is crucial to ensure optimal glycemic control. Despite the challenges, improved glycemic control in individuals with acute illness has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in individuals with this widespread metabolic illness."
2-s2.0-1642528440.xml,"Understanding of the mechanisms of interaction among nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-selected mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) coding sequence is essential for the design of newer drugs and for enhancing our vision of the structure function relationship among amino acids of the polymerase domain of HIV-1. Although several nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors select RT mutations K65R and L74V, the combination of 65R + 74V is rare in clinics. A novel NRTI (-)-β-D-dioxolane-guanosine (DXG) is known to select in vitro either the 65R or 74V mutant virus (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 44 (2000) 1783). These mutations were not selected together during repeated passaging of the HIV-1 in the presence of this drug. To analyze the impact of these RT mutations on viral replication, a double mutant containing K65R + L74V was created by site-directed mutagenesis in a pNL4-3 background. Replication kinetic assays revealed that the mutant K65R + L74V is unstable, and 65R→K reversion occurs during replication of virus in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells in the absence of selection pressure. Replication kinetic assays in MT-2 cells demonstrated that double mutant 65R + 74V is highly attenuated for replication and the initiation of reversion is related to the increase in RT activity. Additionally, the suppression of viral replication in the presence of DXG or under suboptimal human recombinant interleukin-2 leads to minimal or no 65R→K reversion. These observations provide evidence that 65R→K reversion in the double mutant 65R + 74V is dependent on a specific rate of viral replication in a pNL4-3 background. A similar phenomenon may occur in vivo, which may have implications for treatment management strategies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The results of performance and carcass characteristics were submitted to analysis of variance using the Studen Newman Keuls test at 0.05 probability. In the period of 1-21 days of age, the supplementation with probiotics for poultry raised in the new litter reduced feed intake, whereas in those raised in reused litter, the diet free of growth promoter showed a lower consumption. Poultry from 1 to 42 days raised in new litter had lower feed intake when supplemented with probiotics. Other results of performance and carcass yield were not affected. For the poultry raised in reused litter, the use of probiotics resulted in lower thigh yield and higher liver yield.

METHODS: A systematic search strategy identified qualitative studies exploring the phenomenon of living with inflammatory bowel disease. Databases included MEDLINE, PsychInfo, EMBASE, CINAHL and the British Nursing Index via the OVID platform. Qualitative search filters were adapted from Hedges database (http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/hslt/miner/ digital_library/tip_sheets/Cinahl_eb_filters.pdf). Qualitative empirical studies exploring the health and social needs of people living with inflammatory bowel disease were selected. Study eligibility and data extraction were independently completed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative studies. The studies were analysed and synthesised using metasynthesis methodology. The themes from the studies allowed for common translations into a new interpretation of the impact of living with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Of 1395 studies, six published studies and one unpublished thesis fulfilled the inclusion criteria. First iteration of synthesis identified 16 themes, 2nd iteration synthesised these into three main 2nd order constructs: ""detained by the disease""; ""living in a world of disease"" and ""wrestling with life"". ""Detained by the disease"" is the fear of incontinence, the behaviour the patients display due to the fear, and the impact this has on the individual, such as social isolation and missing out on life events. All of these serve to ""pull"" the patient back from normal living. ""Living in a world of disease"" is the long term effects of living with a long term condition and the fear of these effects. ""Wrestling with life"" is the continued fight to thrive, the ""push"" to continue normal living. CONCLUSION: The metasynthesis provides a comprehensive representation of living with IBD. The unmistakeable burden of incontinence is exposed and its ongoing effects are demonstrated. The combined overall impact of living with IBD is the tension these patients live with: ""Pushed and pulled: a compromised life"", people living with IBD experience a constant conflict throughout their lives, they push to be normal but IBD pulls them back. The impact of the fear of incontinence and behaviour of the individual as a result, requires further qualitative enquiry. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-84874235217.xml,"Background: Proteinuria and dilatation of the urinary tract are both relatively common in pregnancy, the latter with a spectrum of symptoms, from none to severe pain and infection. Proteinuria is a rare occurrence in acute obstructive nephropathy; it has been reported in pregnancy, where it may pose a challenging differential diagnosis with pre-eclampsia.The aim of the present study is to report on the incidence of proteinuria (0.3; 0.5g/day) in association with symptomatic-severe urinary tract dilatation in pregnancy. Methods. Case series. Setting: Nephrological-Obstetric Unit dedicated to pregnancy and kidney diseases (January 2000-April 2011). Source: database prospectively updated since the start of the Unit. Retrospective review of clinical charts identified as relevant on the database, by a nephrologist and an obstetrician. Results: From January 2000 to April 2011, 262 pregnancies were referred. Urinary tract dilatation with or without infection was the main cause of referral in 26 cases (predominantly monolateral in 19 cases): 23 singletons, 1 lost to follow-up, 1 twin and 1 triplet. Patients were referred for urinary tract infection (15 cases) and/or renal pain (10 cases); 6 patients were treated by urologic interventions (JJ stenting). Among them, 11 singletons and 1 triple pregnancy developed proteinuria 0.3g/day (46.1%). Proteinuria was 0.5g/day in 6 singletons (23.1%). Proteinuria resolved after delivery in all cases. No patient developed hypertension; in none was an alternative cause of proteinuria evident. No significant demographic difference was observed in patients with renal dilatation who developed proteinuria versus those who did not. An association with the presence of JJ stenting was present (5/6 cases with proteinuria 0.5g/day), which may reflect both severer obstruction and a role for vescico-ureteral reflux, induced by the stent. Conclusions: Symptomatic urinary tract dilatation may be associated with proteinuria in pregnancy. This association should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis with other causes of proteinuria in pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia. © 2013 Piccoli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."
2-s2.0-84874191694.xml,"Networks of pristine high quality single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), the SWNTs after Ar-plasma treatment (from 2 to 12 min) and carbon nanobuds (CNBs) have been tested for ethanol vapor sensing. It was found that the pristine high quality SWNTs do not exhibit any ethanol sensitivity, while the introduction of defects in the tubes results in the appearance of the ethanol sensitivity. The CNB network showed ethanol sensitivity without plasma treatment. Both CNB and low defect (after 3 min treatment) SWNT networks exhibit significant drift in the resistance baseline, while heavily plasma-treated (9 min) SWNTs exhibited high ethanol vapor sensitivity without the baseline change. The mechanisms of the ethanol sensitivity and stability after the plasma irradiation are attributed to the formation of sensitive dangling bonds in the SWNTs and formation of defect channels facilitating access of the ethanol vapor to all parts of the bundled nanotubes.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2012 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The main conclusion is that most of the organisations consider the process orientation, customer orientation and improvement work to have been improved as a result of the participation in the quality award process. However, there are also obstacles to surmount in order to benefit fully from the process: difficulties in finding resources within the organisation to perform mandatory work and implement identified improvements, and difficulties in applying the circumstantial model used in the quality award process."

However, employee governance is rare in advanced market economies due to its relative inefficiency compared with shareholder governance. Given this inefficiency, should employee governance be given up as an impractical ideal? This article contends that the debate over this question is hampered by an inadequate conception of employee governance that fails to take into account the difference between employees and shareholders. It offers a different, more adequate conception of employee governance that recognizes a sense in which employees currently have some ownership rights. The argument for this conception of employee governance is built on an expanded understanding of the ownership of a firm. The article also suggests new strategies for strengthening the role of employees in corporate governance."

The expression of AQPs has been described in rat brain by several studies. Despite recent reports that have shown an over-expression of AQP1 and 4 in human tumoral cells, little is known about AQP expression in human brain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of AQP1 and AQP4 in human brain after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and in peritumoral tissue by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The results showed a marked increase of the expression of AQP1 and AQP4. This over-expression occurred on the astrocytic processes and polarization on astrocytic end-feet was lost. No expression was observed on neuronal cells. This study is the first demonstration of the induction of AQP1 and AQP4 on reactive astrocytes in an acute brain injury, such as SAH. These results reinforce the hypothesis that AQPs may be involved in the dynamics of brain edema formation or resolution. Further studies are needed to understand their functional role."

Therefore, extensive research concerning the reduction of fine particle emissions is needed to further improve air quality. Regarding health effects, especially the emission characteristics of fine and ultrafine particles emerging from anthropogenic sources such as combustion processes are of special interest. This study shows that the emission characteristic of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) due to re-entrainment of fine particles and their subsequent release into the atmosphere can be significantly lowered by application of different operating conditions. For this purpose the particle collection efficiency of an ESP was studied in a municipal sewage sludge incineration plant. Particles were sampled under different operating conditions upstream and downstream from the ESP, and the particle number concentrations were measured simultaneously with aerodynamic particle sizers. In addition, the size distribution of the particles downstream from the ESP was measured with high time resolution by an electrical low-pressure impactor to investigate the particle re-entrainment into the flue gas. To determine the influence of operating conditions, different rapping cycles were investigated regarding their impact on the collection efficiency and the subsequent particle re-entrainment."

However, in reality, user-specified trust relations are very sparse, i.e., a tiny number of pairs of users with trust relations are buried in a disproportionately large number of pairs without trust relations, making trust prediction a daunting task. As an important social concept, however, trust has received growing attention and interest. Social theories are developed for understanding trust. Homophily is one of the most important theories that explain why trust relations are established. Exploiting the homophily effect for trust prediction provides challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we embark on the challenges to investigate the trust prediction problem with the homophily effect. First, we delineate how it differs from existing approaches to trust prediction in an unsupervised setting. Next, we formulate the new trust prediction problem into an optimization problem integrated with homophily, empirically evaluate our approach on two datasets from real-world product review sites, and compare with representative algorithms to gain a deep understanding of the role of homophily in trust prediction. © 2013 ACM."

Additional 10 healthy lambs were included as controls (Group II). We were aimed to make definitive diagnosis of photosensitization, which can be confused with blue tongue, big head and sunburns and to establish etiology as primary or hepatogenous. In total blood analyses, the leukocyte count was higher, but thrombocyte count was lower (thrombocytopenia) in Group I compared to Group II. The lower MCV indicates presence of a case of microcytosis. Furthermore, affected lambs had significantly higher levels of phylloerythrin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol and serum urea nitrogen. Histopathological lesions included periaciner necrosis, periportal fibrosis and biliary duct hyperplasy. The grazing field, where the lambs had been grazing, was very rich in Tribulus terrestris, a hepatotoxic plant. Based on the increased levels of phylloerythrin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase as well as pathological findings in liver, the cases were diagnosed as hepatogenous photosensitization. In addition, presence of Tribulus terrestris in the grazing pasture strongly supported the diagnosis. Increased levels of serum malondialdehyde in affected lambs showed an ongoing oxidative stress. In addition, thrombocytopenia in such cases should be considered as a risk factor for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Thus in addition to a semptomatical treatment protocol, use of antioxidants, anticoagulants, and liver protective agents shoud be taken into consideration in hepatogenous photosensitization in lambs."

We perform typical optimizations on the kernels, which leads to significant performance improvement (up to two orders of magnitude). Finally, we present a performance model for the three aggregators to predict the aggregation speed for a given pair of input images on a given architecture.

Practices are typically unregulated and not informed by research, especially research into the human dimensions of the tourist experience. Dolphin watching tourism at Lovina, Bali, started in the late 1980s when local fishers formed self-regulating cooperatives. Up to 180 dedicated operators use small fishing vessels to carry passengers to watch dolphins close to shore. Most tourists come from western countries, although the industry also attracts Asian visitors. Most visitors are tertiary-educated. Tourist satisfaction ranges from low to medium. While there was no significant difference between the average satisfaction of western and Asian tourists, the associated variables were different. The satisfaction of western tourists was associated with encounter management, preferred number of boats and the number of dolphins seen. Encounter management was the only variable associated with the satisfaction of Asian tourists. Satisfaction was positively associated with willingness to recommend the tour: western respondents who felt neutral to very comfortable with their dolphin encounters were more likely to promote the tour. Better understanding of the tourist experience is crucial in designing sustainable marine wildlife tourism in developing countries; such research appears to be rare. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of simulated injury on the stiffness and material properties of the AB-IGHL during tensile deformation. Using a combined experimental and computational methodology, the stiffness and material properties of six AB-IGHL samples during tensile elongation were determined before and after simulated injury. The AB-IGHL was subjected to 12.7 ± 3.2 % maximum principal strain which resulted in 2.5 ± 0.9 % nonrecoverable strain.

2-s2.0-84874236697.xml,"Granulomas represent a spectrum of inflammatory sequestration responses that may be initiated by a variety of agents, including non-infectious environmental factors and infectious microbial pathogens. Although this reaction is designed to be protective, the associated tissue injury is often responsible for a profound degree of pathology. While many of the mechanisms that sustain the development of the granuloma are enigmatic, it is accepted that the maintenance of this inflammatory process is dependent upon dynamic interactions between an inciting agent, inflammatory mediators, various immune and inflammatory cells, and structural cells of the involved tissue. The best studied of the host-dependent processes during granuloma development is the innate and adaptive immune response. The innate immune response by antigen-presenting cells [APCs; dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages] is initiated quickly to protect from overwhelming pathogens, but with time, can also activate the adaptive immune response. APCs, essential regulators of the innate immune response, can respond to microbial ligands through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which function in the recognition of microbial components and play an important role to link the innate and adaptive immune responses. CD4+ T helper (Th) cells are essential regulators of adaptive immune responses and inflammatory diseases. Recently, the Notch system has been shown to be an important bridge between APCs and T cell communication circuits. In the present review, we discuss recent findings that explore the mechanisms in the linkage of innate and adaptive immunity, including granulomatous formation though TLRs and Notch activation."

2-s2.0-84873968314.xml,"The reasons for the existence of two gas phase conformers for electrosprayed ions of the large tetradecameric protein complex GroEL are considered. Key features are that: (1) both conformers extrapolate to very similar cross sections in the limit of zero charge; (2) both conformers supercharge above the maximum value permitted by the Rayleigh criterion; and (3) one of the conformers supercharges substantially more than the other. We hypothesize that the supercharging observed is associated to the approximately cylindrical shape of GroEL in aqueous solution, enabling accumulation of extra charge on either one or two of its bases when they intersect the evaporating drop surface. The two conformers would then correspond to cases when either one or the two bases of the cylinder carry extra charge. Apparently, the conformer symmetrically (doubly) supercharged on both ends is Coulombically stretched, therefore exhibiting a mobility different from the conformer asymmetrically supercharged only on one end. Several general consequences follow. First, non-spherical proteins may generally be charged above the usual Rayleigh limit. Second, we confirm the previously advanced but contentious notion that gas phase protein ions are readily compacted or stretched away from their crystal structure by capillary and Coulombic forces during the electrospraying process. © 2012 American Society for Mass Spectrometry."

We also model the spectral energy distributions of Glass Ia and Ib to test if the system is a young member of the Chameleon I star-forming region, and we consider other possible classifications for the system. We find that Glass Ib is highly variable, showing changes in continuum strength and emission features at optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared wavelengths. The optical light curve indicates that a central stellar component in Glass Ib became entirely visible for 2.5 years beginning in mid-2002 and possibly displayed periodic variability with repeated, short-period dimming during that time. As the fine-structure emission was not detected in observations before or after our Spitzer IRS observation, we explore whether the variable nature of Glass Ib is related to the gas being highly ionized, possibly due to variable accretion or an X-ray flare. © 2013.

Nasal and exhaled levels of NO can be determined by non-invasive techniques using chemiluminescence analysers. NO levels in the upper airways are 10-100-fold higher than in the lower airways. International recommendations for standardized measurement of nasal and exhaled NO have been published recently. Exhaled NO is increased in patients with untreated asthma, and this elevation reflects, at least partially, bronchial inflammation. Measurement of exhaled NO may be useful when the diagnosis is doubtfull and for differentiation from other causes of chronic cough. Nasal NO is usually also increased in asthma but this is related to the frequency of allergic rhinitis in asthmatic patients. However, in patients with nasal polyps and asthma, nasal NO is decreased in proportion to the extent of sinusoidal involvement. Levels of exhaled NO decrease rapidly in asthmatic patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.

Most studies accomplish this task by using the gene encoding cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI; Entrez COX1). Within this barcoding framework, many taxonomic initiatives exist, such as those specializing in fishes, birds, mammals, and fungi. Other efforts center on regions, such as the Arctic, or on other topics, such as health. DNA barcoding initiatives exist for all groups of vertebrates except for amphibians and nonavian reptiles. We announce the formation of Cold Code, the international initiative to DNA barcode all species of these 'cold-blooded' vertebrates. The project has a Steering Committee, Coordinators, and a home page.

Ten ileostomies were formed because of anastomotic leak, eight to protect the anastomosis, although there were no signs of insufficiency at the time of the intraoperative testing. Sixteen of the 18 patients had no complications. There were two complications in connection with ileostomies, these stomas were closed earlier than usual. Two other patients needed permanent stomas. Fourteen ileostomies were reversed without complications after 6-8 weeks. Two patients with local septic complications, following the closure, were treated conservatively. No reoperations were needed because of anal incontinence or anastomotic stenosis. We consider loop ileostomy safe with low morbidity, it can prevent diffuse peritonitis and/or a permanent stoma.

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, we took into account 3 years from 1st Jan. 2009 to 31st March.2012. Treatment adherence was quantified utilizing ratio between RDD and PDD (Prescribed Daily Dose). Persistence is reckoned taking into account the actual therapy days, comparing posology with supplied dose, drawing the graph using Kaplan-Meir method. Results: Adherence results in values between 0.8 and 1.0 for Nilotinib (Adh = 0.93), Imatinib (Adh = 0.83) and Dasatinib (0.85). Imatinib has better persistence, 90% of patients in treatment exceed one year of treatment versus 83.3% for Nilotinib and 80% for Dasatinib. The cost per single day of treatment (cost per RDD) was € 39.41 for Imatinib, € 113.60 for Nilotinib and € 94.84 for Dasatinib. Conclusion: Patients with CML have a loose of adherence both in first line with Imatinib and in second line of therapy with Dasatinib and Nilotinib.

2-s2.0-84873988229.xml,"Current artificial immune system (AIS) classifiers have two major problems: (1) their populations of B-cells can grow to huge proportions and (2) optimizing one B-cell (part of the classifier) at a time does not necessarily guarantee that the B-cell pool (the whole classifier) will be optimized. In this paper, we describe the design of a new AIS algorithm and classifier system called simple AIS (SAIS). It is different from traditional AIS classifiers in that it takes only one B-cell, instead of a B-cell pool, to represent the classifier. This approach ensures global optimization of the whole system and in addition no population control mechanism is needed. We have tested our classifier on four benchmark datasets using different classification techniques and found it to be very competitive when compared to other classifiers. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006."
2-s2.0-1542752744.xml,"The gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) has been documented visiting and breaking the eggs of artificial nests, but the implications of such observations are unclear because there is little cost in depredating an undefended nest. During the summer of 2001 at Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas, we videotaped a gray catbird that broke and consumed at least 1 egg in a brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum) nest. Our observation was consistent with egg predation because the catbird consumed the contents of the damaged egg after breaking it. The large difference in body mass suggests that a catbird (37 g) destroying eggs in a thrasher (69 g) nest might risk injury if caught in the act of predation and might explain why egg prédation by catbirds has been poorly documented. Our observation indicated that the catbird should be considered as an egg predator of natural nests and that single-egg predation of songbird nests should not be attributed to egg removal by female brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) without additional evidence."

The forward modeling is based on a domain integral equation approach formulated in terms of the electric and magnetic contrast sources normalized with the characteristic impedance of the background medium. Our numerical tests indicate that this formulation is prerequisite in order to arrive at a forward solution within an acceptable number of iterations, and hence it is also of significant importance in the optimization process of the inverse problem. The inverse scattering problem is attacked using the Multiplicative Regularized Contrast Source Inversion method as known in the literature. The complexity of this inverse method is approximately equal to the complexity of two equivalent forward algorithms of the conjugate gradient type.

A potential source of this shortcoming is that the majority of empirical studies focus only on a single specified etiology of suicide. Aims: To address this limitation, we present a further promising way to understand the suicidal state. We do so (1) by providing a brief review of something known as worlds theory (Bergner, 2006), and (b) by presenting the results of a study exploring the relationship between a person's taking it thathis or her world is impossible/nonviable and his or her suicidal state. Methods: In this research, participants were asked to assess the perceived levels of world viability (vs. impossibility/nonviability) of 12 actual persons depicted in clinical vignettes. Results:As predicted, participants judged the worlds of suicidal committers significantly more nonviable than those of suicide attempters, and these in turn significantly more nonviable than those of mentally disordered but nonsuicidal persons. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the worlds of suicidal persons are unlivable-in worlds terms: impossible.

Aims: To clarify and contrast risk factors for such deaths among cancer patients. Methods: A SEER (1973-2007) analysis was conducted on 4,449,957 cancer patients comparing all causes of death (COD) to accidental and suicidal deaths through competing hazards, relative risk andproportional hazards models. SEER did not provide psychological assessments; the analysiswas confined to their standard epidemiological and clinicopathological parameters. Results: 2,557,385 overall deaths yielded 16,879 (0.66%) accidents and 6,589 (0.26%) suicides. Mortality reached its highest incidence immediately after diagnosis and obeyed Pareto type II distributions. The major identifiable risk factor for suicide was male gender; for accidental death, First Nations ethnicity; and all COD, metastases. Minor factors for suicide included metastases, advanced age, and respiratory as well as head and neck tumors, whereas for accidental death they were male gender, metastases, advanced age, and brain tumors. Conclusions: Differences were observed in the risk patterns of suicide and accidental death, suggesting distinct etiologies. A high incidence of suicides and accidental deaths following diagnosis (attributed by some to stress from the diagnosis of cancer) correlated here with overall mortality and indicators of physical morbidity.

2-s2.0-1542468105.xml,"We present a velocity-oriented discrete analog of the partial differential equations governing porous media flow: the edge-based face element method. Conventional finite element techniques calculate pressures in the nodes of the grid. However, such methods do not satisfy the requirement of flux continuity at the faces. In contrast, the edge-based method calculates vector potentials along the edges, leading to continuity of fluxes. The method is algebraically equivalent with the popular block-centered finite difference method and with the mixed-hybrid finite element method, but is algorithmically different and has the same robustness as the more conventional node-based velocity-oriented method. The numerical examples are computed analytically and may, therefore, be considered as an 'heuristic proof' of the theory and its practical applicability for reservoir engineering and geohydrology. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Methods. A national cross-sectional study was performed in primary care consults. The following data were collected: demographic and anthropometric information; list of present cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF); previous macrovascular and microvascular disease history; physical examination and analytical data from the previous 12 months, including the urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to evaluate renal function. Results: With regard to the patients, 27.9% presented some degree of CKD as follows: 3.5% with stage 1; 6.4% with stage 2; 16.8% with stage 3 (11.6% with stage 3A and 5.2% with stage 3B); and 1.2% with stages 4 and 5. The prevalence of patients with UACR ≥ 30 mg/g was 15.4% (13% microalbuminuria and 2.4% macroalbuminuria). Renal impairment (RI) was found in 206 patients (18%) of whom 133 patients (64.6%) was stage 3A, 60 patients (29.1%) was stage 3B and 13 patients (6.3%) stages 4 and 5. Among patients with RI, 143 patients (69.4%) had normoalbuminuria.The following variables were significantly associated with CKD: age; sex (women); systolic arterial blood pressure (SABP) ≥ 150 mmHg; and a previous history of cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: The results showed that the prevalence for any type of CKD was 27.9%. A systematic determination of UACR and eGFR may contribute to an early diagnosis, thus allowing intervention during the initial stages of the disease when treatment is more efficient. © 2013 Rodriguez-Poncelas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The most important proto-oncogen factors for colon cancer appear to be epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR, and c-Src with high expression and activity leading to tumor growth and ultimately to colon cancer progression. Application of c-Src and EGFR antisense agents simultaneously should theoretically therefore have major benefit. In the present study, anti-EGFR and c-Src specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were combined in a formulation using PAMAM dendrimers as a carrier. Nano drug entry into cells was confirmed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy imaging and real time PCR showed gene expression of c-Src and EGFR, as well as downstream STAT5 and MAPK-1 with the tumor suppressor gene P53 to all be downregulated. EGFR and c-Src protein expression was also reduced when assessed by western blotting techniques. The effect of the antisense oligonucleotide on HT29 cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay, reduction beijng observed after 48 hours. In summary, nano-drug, anti-EGFR and c-Src specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were effectively transferred into HT-29 cells and inhibited gene expression in target cells.

Subjects listened to sentences like Jane told her brother that he was exceptionally quick/slow, designed such that the alternative critical words were equally acceptable within the local sentence context. In Experiment 1, these sentences were embedded in a discourse that rendered one of the critical words anomalous (e.g. because Jane's brother had in fact done something very quickly). Relative to the coherent alternative, these discourse-anomalous words elicited a standard N400 effect that started at 150-200 ms after acoustic word onset. Furthermore, when the same sentences were heard in isolation in Experiment 2, the N400 effect disappeared. The results demonstrate that our listeners related the unfolding spoken words to the wider discourse extremely rapidly, after having heard the first two or three phonemes only, and in many cases well before the end of the word. In addition, the identical nature of discourse- and sentence-dependent N400 effects suggests that from the perspective of the word-elicited comprehension process indexed by the N400, the interpretive context delineated by a single unfolding sentence and a larger discourse is functionally identical. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

2-s2.0-1642458324.xml,"Immune responses to the intracellular Wolbachia bacteria of filarial nematodes are thought to contribute to the pathologic process of filarial infection. Here, we compare antibody responses of subjects living in an area where lymphatic filariasis is endemic with antibody responses elicited in a murine model of filarial infection, to provide evidence that the infective larval stage (L3), not adult nematodes, are the primary inducer of responses against Wolbachia. In human subjects, antibody responses to Brugia malayi Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) are most often correlated with antibody responses to the L3 stage of B. malayi. Analysis of anti-WSP responses induced in mice by different stages of the rodent filariae Litomosoides sigmodontis shows that the strongest anti-WSP response is elicited by the L3 stage. Although adult filarial nematode death may play a role in the generation of an anti-WSP response, it is the L3 stage that is the major source of immunogenic material, and incoming L3 provide a continual boosting of the anti-WSP response.

It is important to precisely characterize the blow-up of the gradient of such an equation. In this paper we show that the blow-up of the gradient can be characterized by a singular function defined by the single layer potential of an eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue 1/2 of a Neumann-Poincaré type operator defined on the boundaries of the inclusions. By comparing the singular function with the one corresponding to two disks osculating to the inclusions, we quantitatively characterize the blow-up of the gradient in terms of explicit functions. In electrostatics, our results apply to the electric field, which is the gradient of the solution to the conductivity equation, in the case where perfectly conducting or insulating inclusions are closely located. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2-s2.0-84874225625.xml,"Actually, there is a controversial discussion in automotive industry if the deployment of inductive power supply is able to avoid the disadvantages of conductive vehicle charging systems. Available charging systems for electric vehicles use wires to connect the vehicle to the grid. This leads to several disadvantages such as vandalism and additional effort for the driver. Furthermore, loose or faulty cables are a safety risk. As an alternative, non-contact charging of electric vehicles allows for a simple, reliable and safe charging process. It improves the user acceptance and contributes to the integration of electric vehicles into the market. Thus, the availability to the grid is increased, which offers a higher degree of flexibility for the storage management. © 2012 IEEE."

The HC5 PCR product was cloned and sequenced and showed 94% nucleotide sequence similarity to ratp28. The HC5 cDNA sequence open reading frame encodes a predicted 75 amino acid (8.0kDa) protein, and is therefore truncated compared to ratp28 (195 amino acids, 21.6kDa). In vitro transcription and translation of the HC5 cDNA resulted in the production of 2 proteins of approximately 8 and 6kDa. Restriction digests from various tissues demonstrated that liver and heart expressed primarily ratp28 mRNA whereas kidney and blood contained both ratp28 and HC5 transcripts. Phage display was employed to generate an antibody fragment to a peptide sequence conserved in ratp28 and HC5. Western blotting identified a 10kDa protein in cytosolic fractions of rat kidney.

It is shown that a standard formulation of the BB-BC algorithm occasionally falls short of producing acceptable solutions to problems from discrete size optimum design of steel trusses. A reformulation of the algorithm is proposed and implemented for design optimization of various discrete truss structures according to American Institute of Steel Construction Allowable Stress Design (AISC-ASD) specifications. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed BB-BC algorithm is compared to its standard version as well as other well-known metaheuristic techniques.

2-s2.0-1642291070.xml,"Simulations in the authors' previous studies have shown that a modified temperature integration regime with a 6-day averaging period and increased set-point flexibility was able to reduce annual energy consumption by up to 9% as compared to a regular temperature integration regime. The commonly applied fixed set-point for relative humidity (RH) of 80-85% strongly reduced the potential for energy saving with this regime. Therefore, a more flexible humidity control regime was developed. Simulations indicated that yearly energy consumption could be reduced by 18% as compared to a fixed set-point of 80% RH. By combining the two regimes (temperature integration and humidity control), it was predicted that the energy saving would be even greater. To test this prediction, the combined regimes were applied in two experiments with cut-flower chrysanthemum crops investigating the effect on plant development and growth. Different temperature bandwidths for temperature integration (±2, ±4, ±6 and ±8°C) were also compared within the joint regime. Crop development was only delayed with the ±8°C temperature bandwidth. The best regime with respect to plant development, growth, quality and energy saving (±6°C temperature bandwidth) was compared in a spring experiment with a climate regime used in commercial practice. Energy consumption was 23.5% less with the joint regime. No negative consequences of high humidity were observed, but there was a strong increase in the dry weight of all plant organs. Total plant dry weight was 39% higher than in the regular regime. It can be concluded that energy saving and crop yield increase can be achieved simultaneously, although the dynamic temperature control has to be adjusted to the chrysanthemum developmental stage. The combined dynamic climate regime forms a promising basis for future climate controllers and is easily extendable to other greenhouse crops. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Knowledge of the plaque composition, vulnerability and its elastic properties can assist the clinician in selecting appropriate interventional techniques. However, several noise sources have to be addressed to obtain quality intravascular elastograms. Misalignment of the vessel lumen and the ultrasound beam can produce erroneous strain estimates in elastography. Errors in the strain estimate are introduced due to the eccentricity and tilt of the intravascular transducer within the vessel lumen. Previous work in this area has provided theoretical expressions for the correction of eccentricity and tilt errors when they occur independent of each other. However, under most imaging conditions, both eccentricity and tilt errors are simultaneously present. In this paper, we extend the theoretical correction factor by accounting for the influence of both of these errors occurring simultaneously in the positioning of the catheter within the vessel lumen."

The mammalian genome contains four paralogs, Tns1, Tns2, Tns3, and Tns4. Murine mutations in the Tns1 and Tns2 genes cause polycystic kidney disease and glomerular sclerosis, respectively, and Tns3-null mice exhibit an impaired intestinal epithelial development. However, the knowledge concerning the localization of each tensin is still fragmentary. In this study, the cellular and subcellular distributions of tensin members were defined and compared with each other. RT-PCR analysis indicated that Tns2 and Tns3 were more abundant in isolated glomeruli and that Tns1 was highly expressed in areas other than the glomeruli, but no Tns4 expression was observed in the kidney. All tensin members were detected in the small intestine. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that Tns1 was predominantly localized to the mesangium of glomeruli and renal tubules. In contrast, Tns2 and Tns3 were highly expressed in the podocytes and the partial collecting system. In the small intestine, Tns2 and Tns3 were highly expressed in crypt and villous epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that Tns3 was colocalized with TJ protein ZO-1 in renal tubules.

Such methods are frequently limited either by cellular detachment or by an inability to image cells at high temporal or spatial resolution. Previously, we preserved cellular adhesion during loading and imaging by using a flexible silicone membrane inverted over a glass coverslip. This enabled high magnification real-time imaging of subcellular structures but chemical and physical access to the cells was limited due to geometric constraints. In this study, we present a method to integrate thin films made from poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) into a novel device. The optically clear PDMS thin films allow simultaneous tensile loading and high magnification microscopy without the need to invert the cells, maintaining physical access during experiments. To characterize the utility of this technology, we evaluated fabrication conditions for optimizing the geometry, durability, and uniformity of these films. Additionally, we demonstrate the suitability of this device for use in high-magnification, live-cell fluorescence microscopy by examining the response of the cytoskeletal protein actin, expressed in cultured primary sensory neurons, to a tensile load.

In light of recent work demonstrating similarity between the division cycle of C. crescentus and that of A. tumefaciens, the functional conservation for this presumptive control pathway was examined. In C. crescentus the CtrA response regulator serves as the master regulator of cell cycle progression and cell division. CtrA activity is controlled by an integrated pair of multi-component phosphorelays: PleC/DivJ-DivK and CckA-ChpT-CtrA. Although several of the conserved orthologues appear to be essential in A. tumefaciens, deletions in pleC or divK were isolated and resulted in cell division defects, diminished swimming motility, and a decrease in biofilm formation. A. tumefaciens also has two additional pleC/divJ homologue sensor kinases called pdhS1 and pdhS2, absent in C. crescentus. Deletion of pdhS1 phenocopied the ΔpleC and ΔdivK mutants. Cells lacking pdhS2 morphologically resembled wild-type bacteria, but were decreased in swimming motility and elevated for biofilm formation, suggesting that pdhS2 may serve to regulate the motile to non-motile switch in A. tumefaciens. Genetic analysis suggests that the PleC/DivJ-DivK and CckA-ChpT-CtrA phosphorelays in A. tumefaciens are vertically-integrated, as in C. crescentus. A gain-of-function mutation in CckA (Y674D) was identified as a spontaneous suppressor of the ΔpleC motility phenotype. Thus, although the core architecture of the A. tumefaciens pathway resembles that of C. crescentus there are specific differences including additional regulators, divergent pathway architecture, and distinct target functions. © 2013 Kim et al."

Hemangiomas demonstrated peak enhancement during the arterial phase, and both the SIR with Gd-EOB-DDTPA-enhanced MRI and the attenuation value with enhanced CT decreased with time. The SIR of hemangiomas was lower than that of liver parenchyma during the equilibrium and hepatobiliary phases on Gd-EOB-enhanced MRI. However, the attenuation of hemangiomas after contrast injection was higher than that of liver parenchyma during all phases of enhanced CT. CONCLUSION: Prolonged enhancement during the equilibrium phase was observed less frequently on Gd-EOB-DDTPA-enhanced MRI than enhanced CT, which may exacerbate differentiating between hemangiomas and malignant tumors. © 2012 Baishideng.

To date, the concept of personalized medicine has referred largely to the field of pharmacogenomics. In contrast, relatively few data exist regarding the application of preventive strategies such as physical exercise in the context of personalized medicine. Within this review, we highlight the extant literature and propose five strategies for scientists that may propel the exercise and sports science fields toward this global goal. Notably, these approaches are in addition to methods to maintain adherence to training - a well-known factor in determining exercise responsiveness. Briefly, these strategies include (1) evaluating participant responses to training at the individual as well as group level; (2) identifying sources of variability in responsiveness to training; (3) optimizing exercise dosing strategies to maximize benefits while minimizing barriers to participation; (4) evaluating the efficacy of multimodal interventions for relevant population subgroups; and (5) increasing the clinical relevance of study populations and outcomes in exercise trials. We look forward to seeing these strategies considered in trials of preventive health interventions such as exercise.

We scrutinized 22 known TCR/pMHC complex crystal structures, and did not find any predicted molecular Cα-Cα contacts in these crystals that would allow for physiological TCR dimerization. Moreover, the presence of conserved glycan adducts on the outer face of the Cα domain preclude the hypothesizedTCR dimerization through the Cα domain.

Formally verifying an optimizing compiler, as one would verify any other large program, is not feasible due to its size, ongoing evolution and modification, and, possibly, proprietary considerations. Translation validation is a novel approach that offers an alternative to the verification of translators in general and compilers in particular: Rather than verifying the compiler itself, one constructs a validation tool which, after every run of the compiler, formally confirms that the target code produced in the run is a correct translation of the source program. The paper presents VOC, a methodology for the translation validation of optimizing compilers. We distinguish between structure, preserving optimizations, for which we establish a simulation relation between the source and target code based on computational induction, and structure modifying optimizations, for which we develop specialized ""permutation rules.

An imbalance of their profile in favour of inflammation initiation may lead to disease states, such as that is observed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although Crohn's disease (CD) is often described as a prototype of T-helper 1-type diseases, and ulcerative colitis (UC) is traditionally viewed as a T-helper 2-mediated condition, the classic paradigm, which categorises cytokines into pro- and anti-inflammatory groups, has recently been changed. The inflammation regulatory pathways may not be mutually exclusive as individual cytokines can have diverse and even opposing functions in various clinical and immunological settings. None the less there are many common immunological responses in IBD that are mediated by cytokines. Although they regulate and influence the development, course and recurrence of the inflammatory process, the concrete pathogenic role of these small signaling molecules is sometimes not unambiguous in the subtypes of the disease.

2-s2.0-1542606327.xml,"The PEA3/E1AF/ETV4 gene encodes an Ets-related transcription factor that is expressed in the epithelial cells of the mammary gland. Previous reports have shown that PEA3 can up-regulate promoter activities of many genes associated with tumorigenesis. A significant fraction of those encode matrix metalloproteinases (MMP genes) required for degradation of the extracellular matrix. To better obtain a molecular characterization of PEA3 expression in sporadic breast cancer, we quantified PEA3 mRNA by means of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay in a large series of human primary breast tumors. PEA3 expression showed wide variations in tumor tissues, being under-expressed in 30 of 130 (23.1%) and over-expressed in 18 of 130 (13.8%) compared with normal breast tissues. High PEA3 mRNA levels correlated significantly with Scarff-Bloom-Richardson histopathological grade III (P = 0.018) but not with poor prognosis, suggesting that PEA3 is a marker of tumor aggressiveness rather than a prognostic factor in human breast cancer. We also observed positive links between the expression of PEA3 and those of MKI67 and ERBB2 (P = 0.034 and P = 0.045, respectively) and an inverse relationship with ERα (P = 0.0016). Our results do not support recent findings suggesting that PEA3 could be a tumor-suppressor gene that can act therapeutically in ERBB2 over-expressed tumors. Our results also suggest major roles of the MMP2, NRG1 and CGB genes (which encode type I gelatinase, heregulin and human chorionic gonadotropin β subunit, respectively) in the PEA3 pathway dysregulation observed in breast cancer. Taken together, the data confirm the role of the PEA3 gene in breast tumorigenesis, and suggest the existence of numerous other still unknown genes transactivated by the PEA3 transcription factor."

In both species the binocular field is relatively long and narrow with a maximum width of 30° occurring 40° above the bill. The bill tip projects into the lower half of the binocular field. This frontal visual field topography exhibits a number of key features that are also found in other terrestrial birds. This supports the hypothesis that avian visual fields are of three principal types that are correlated with the degree to which vision is employed when taking food items, rather than with phylogeny. However, unlike other species studied to date, in both hornbill species the bill intrudes into the binocular field. This intrusion of the bill restricts the width of the binocular field but allows the birds to view their own bill tips. It is suggested that this is associated with the precision-grasping feeding technique of hornbills. This involves forceps-like grasping and manipulation of items in the tips of the large decurved bill. The two hornbill species differ in the extent of the blind area perpendicularly above the head. Interspecific comparison shows that eye size and the width of the blind area above the head are significantly correlated. The limit of the upper visual field in hornbills is viewed through the long lash-like feathers of the upper lids and these appear to be used as a sunshade mechanism. In Ground Hornbills eye movements are non-conjugate and have sufficient amplitude (30-40°) to abolish the frontal binocular field and to produce markedly asymmetric visual field configurations."

The results obtained concentrate on wideband signaling in a multipath environment, with and without the presence of noise.

The proposed method is strongly dependent on the type of the receiving antenna (a switched parasitic planar array is superior to a ""uniform"" antenna with identical radiation patterns). Increasing the number of radiation patterns available improves the reliability of the method.

Laryngoscopy and CT-scan constitute the explorations of reference. We investigated the value of these two examinations and their association for the evaluation of glottic and supraglottic tumors. METHOD: We compared laryngoscopy and CT findings with those of the pathologic examination of the surgical specimen in a retrospective study of 57 patients. RESULTS: The results were presented by T-staging, then as a function of the laryngeal floor of the tumor and the anatomic localization. The laryngoscopy findings were most contributive for small tumors. Large spaces are better examined with the scanner. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the performance of laryngoscopy and CT-scan for the assessment of glottic and supraglottic tumors can be improved by a better knowledge of the limitations of each type of explorations for this type of assessment. CT-scan currently provides a better topographic assessment of the tumor than endoscopy; even higher performance can be expected with the advent of technological advances."

When 3-day-old rats were injected intracisternally with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), a marked depletion of brain 5-HT was observed when animals were killed 3 months after the treatment. Brain catecholamine content was generally not changed by neurotoxin treatment. The behavioral consequence of intracisternal 5,7-DHT administration to developing rats consisted in reduction of adult rats' activity in the forced swimming test.

The system inputs are assumed to be unknown and then the observers reduce to functions of finite sequences of the output only. The existence of the observer is proved by resorting to both the notion of inverse system and the concept of maximal A-invariant subspaces. A constructive approach to derive the explicit equations of the observer is provided. An example illustrates the efficiency and the computational aspects of the method. © 2012 IEEE.
2-s2.0-84873972156.xml,"Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is able to survive intracellularly in macrophages by preventing normal phagosome maturation processes utilized to destroy bacteria. Infected macrophages often undergo apoptotic cell death to efficiently present bacterial antigens to the host adaptive immune system in a process known as efferocytosis. Recent studies with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) showed that macrophages infected with MTB are less likely to undergo apoptosis than control, uninfected cells. It is proposed that regulation of macrophage apoptosis is an important immune evasion tactic for MTB. Based on the similarity of MAP and MTB, we hypothesized that MAP-infected macrophages would be resistant to apoptosis compared to uninfected cells within the same culture and to cells from uninfected cultures. Our results demonstrate that, indeed, populations of MAP-infected macrophages contain fewer apoptotic cells than similar populations of control cells, and that MAP infection reduces the sensitivity of infected macrophages to induction of apoptosis by H"

As a popular family of formally well-founded and decidable knowledge representation languages, fuzzy Description Logics (fuzzy DLs), which extend DLs with fuzzy logic, are very well suited to cover for representing and reasoning with imprecision and uncertainty. Thus, a requirement naturally arises in many practical applications of knowledge-based systems, in particular the Semantic Web, because DLs are the logical foundation of the Semantic Web. Currently, there have been lots of fuzzy extensions of DLs with Zadeh's fuzzy logic theory papers published, to investigate fuzzy DLs and more importantly serve as identifying the direction of fuzzy DLs study. In this paper, we aim at providing a comprehensive literature overview of fuzzy DLs, and we focus our attention on fuzzy extensions of DLs based on fuzzy set theory. Other relevant formalisms that are based on approaches like probabilistic theory or non-monotonic logics are covered elsewhere. In detail, we first introduce the existing fuzzy DLs (including the syntax, semantics, knowledge base, and reasoning algorithm) from the origin, development (from weaker to stronger in expressive power), some special techniques, and so on. Then, the other important issues on fuzzy DLs, such as reasoning, querying, applications, and directions for future research, are also discussed in detail.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 167 intestinal BD patients between March 1986 and April 2011. We also investigated the endoscopic parameters including ulcer locations, distribution, number, depth, shape, size and margin to identify independent factors associated with DAIBD. An endoscopic severity model was developed using significant colonoscopic variables identified by multivariate regression analysis and its correlation with the DAIBD was evaluated. To determine factors related to the discrepancy between endoscopic severity and clinical activity, clinical characteristics and laboratory markers of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS: A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the number of intestinal ulcers (≥ 2, P = 0.031) and volcanoshaped ulcers (P = 0.001) were predictive factors for the DAIBD. An endoscopic severity model (Y) was developed based on selected endoscopic variables as follows: Y = 47.44 + 9.04 × non-Ileocecal area + 11.85 × ≥ 2 of intestinal ulcers + 5.03 × shallow ulcers + 12.76 × deep ulcers + 4.47 × geographicshaped ulcers + 26.93 × volcano-shaped ulcers + 8.65 × ≥ 20 mm of intestinal ulcers. However, endoscopic parameters used in the multivariate analysis explained only 18.9% of the DAIBD variance. Patients with severe DAIBD scores but with moderately predicted disease activity by the endoscopic severity model had more symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (21.4% vs 4.9%, P = 0.026) and a lower rate of corticosteroid use (50.0% vs 75.6%, P = 0.016) than those with severe DAIBD scores and accurately predicted disease by the model. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the number of intestinal ulcers and volcano-shaped ulcers were predictive factors for severe DAIBD scores.

2-s2.0-84874018138.xml,"Ossified gastralia, clavicles and sternal ribs are known in a variety of reptilians, including dinosaurs. In sauropods, however, the identity of these bones is controversial. The peculiar shapes of these bones complicate their identification, which led to various differing interpretations in the past. Here we describe different elements from the chest region of diplodocids, found near Shell, Wyoming, USA. Five morphotypes are easily distinguishable: (A) elongated, relatively stout, curved elements with a spatulate and a bifurcate end resemble much the previously reported sauropod clavicles, but might actually represent interclavicles; (B) short, L-shaped elements, mostly preserved as a symmetrical pair, probably are the real clavicles, as indicated by new findings in diplodocids; (C) slender, rod-like bones with rugose ends are highly similar to elements identified as sauropod sternal ribs; (D) curved bones with wide, probably medial ends constitute the fourth morphotype, herein interpreted as gastralia; and (E) irregularly shaped elements, often with extended rugosities, are included into the fifth morphotype, tentatively identified as sternal ribs and/or intercostal elements. To our knowledge, the bones previously interpreted as sauropod clavicles were always found as single bones, which sheds doubt on the validity of their identification. Various lines of evidence presented herein suggest they might actually be interclavicles - which are single elements. This would be the first definitive evidence of interclavicles in dinosauromorphs. Previously supposed interclavicles in the early sauropodomorph Massospondylus or the theropods Oviraptor and Velociraptor were later reinterpreted as clavicles or furculae. Independent from their identification, the existence of the reported bones has both phylogenetic and functional significance. Their presence in non-neosauropod Eusauropoda and Flagellicaudata and probable absence in rebbachisaurs and Titanosauriformes shows a clear character polarity. This implicates that the ossification of these bones can be considered plesiomorphic for Sauropoda. The proposed presence of interclavicles in sauropods may give further support to a recent study, which finds a homology of the avian furcula with the interclavicle to be equally parsimonious to the traditional theory that furcula were formed by the fusion of the clavicles. Functional implications are the stabilizing of the chest region, which coincides with the development of elongated cervical and caudal vertebral columns or the use of the tail as defensive weapon. The loss of ossified chest bones coincides with more widely spaced limbs, and the evolution of a wide-gauge locomotor style. © 2012 Anatomical Society."

2-s2.0-1642505414.xml,"A search for genes that promote or block CNS regeneration requires numerous approaches; for example, tests can be made on individual candidate molecules. Here, however, we describe methods for comprehensive identification of genes up- and down-regulated in neurons that can and cannot regenerate after injury. One problem concerns identification of low-abundance genes out of the 30 000 or so genes expressed by neurons. Another difficulty is knowing whether a single gene or multiple genes are necessary. When microchips and subtractive differential display are used to identify genes turned on or off, the numbers are still too great to test which molecules are actually important for regeneration. Candidates are genes coding for trophic, inhibitory, receptor and extracellular matrix molecules, as well as unknown genes. A preparation useful for narrowing the search is the neonatal opossum. The spinal cord and optic nerve can regenerate after injury at 9 days but cannot at 12 days after birth. This narrow window allows genes responsible for the turning off of regeneration to be identified. As a next step, sites at which they are expressed (forebrain, midbrain, spinal cord, neurons or glia, intracellular or extracellular) must be determined. An essential step is to characterize proteins, their levels of expression, and their importance for regeneration. Comprehensive searches for molecular mechanisms represent a lengthy series of experiments that could help in devising strategies for repairing injured spinal cord."

We employ two South African data sets and use linear regression and household fixed effects to investigate the relationship between women's income shares and household expenditures. In married couple households, when women garner larger shares of income, spending on food is higher and spending on alcohol is lower. However, the relationship between women's income shares and expenditures attenuates with additional adults in the household. We find that in households with multiple adults, men and women bargain in gender groups to realize gendered preferences for expenditures. Future work should consider household members outside of the married dyad when modeling bargaining processes. © The Author 2012.

Patients were diagnosed with hepatitis D on the basis of detectable viral antibodies and the presence of HDV-RNA in their serum. A liver biopsy was performed in all cases and fibrosis staging was performed in accordance with the METAVIR scoring system. All eligible patients were administered peg-interferon at a weekly dosage of 1.5 μg/kg body weight for 48 wk. HDV-RNA was assayed at the end of this treatment period and again at 24 wk later. A biochemical response was determined by a normalization of SGPT at the end of the treatment or during follow up. The end of treatment response was defined by a HDV-RNA negative status. A sustained virological response was defined by undetectable serum HDV-RNA at six months after the end of treatment. RESULTS: Among the 277 patients enrolled in our present study, 238 completed a course of peg-interferon therapy of which 180 (75.6%) were male and 58 (24.4%) female. Biochemical responses were achieved in 122/238 (51.3%) patients. End of treatment responses were achieved in 71/238 (29.8%) cases. A SVR was achieved in 70 of these patients (29.4%).

Thousands of gays came together, and by the end of the week more than 200,000 marched through the streets of Rome's historical centre. This unique event provides an opportunity to examine the causal relationship of the gay movement acquiring a political identity of its own while the city of Rome was trying to assert a 'proper' identity for its public spaces. Acting in solidarity for the first time since its formation, the gay movement drew attention to the difficulties in securing unrestricted access to Rome's public spaces. Conservative sectors of society challenged the right to demonstrate, as guaranteed in Italy's Constitution, which resulted in the delay of obtaining the necessary permit. On the one hand, this revealed the existence of sectors of society not yet willing to acknowledge gay rights or even discuss gay issues in public; on the other, it helped make clear that the process for building Rome's identity is governed by a specific political design. In particular, policies for the privatisation of urban space in conjunction with discriminatory planning processes in the city's historical centre, point to tourism as a powerful tool to control urban space. Resisting this spatial marginalization the gay movement has significantly widened the scope of its social and political action in order to contest prevailing practices and trends which are shaping the city."

It was found that the pristine high quality SWNTs do not exhibit any ethanol sensitivity, while the introduction of defects in the tubes results in the appearance of the ethanol sensitivity. The CNB network showed ethanol sensitivity without plasma treatment. Both CNB and low defect (after 3 min treatment) SWNT networks exhibit significant drift in the resistance baseline, while heavily plasma-treated (9 min) SWNTs exhibited high ethanol vapor sensitivity without the baseline change. The mechanisms of the ethanol sensitivity and stability after the plasma irradiation are attributed to the formation of sensitive dangling bonds in the SWNTs and formation of defect channels facilitating access of the ethanol vapor to all parts of the bundled nanotubes.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2012 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Here, we outline the five papers contained in the issue, all of which challenge the idea that the language of socially disadvantaged children is linguistically deprived. The papers present new theoretical and empirical approaches to the question, and they extend the debates originally articulated by Labov in the 1960s. Overall, we as editors hope that this special issue will stimulate others to take up the argument, using new approaches and including those members of disadvantaged groups who have thus far not been allowed a voice. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

2-s2.0-84874126500.xml,"In this paper a real-time mobile robot motion planning system is proposed. This is done by extracting the sensory data of the IR sensors of the robot during offline training of the robot. The mobile agent is able to interact with an unknown environment using a reactive strategy determined by sensory data. After classifying the data into several classes we formulate the Gaussian membership function of each feature of the respective classes. The features here correspond to the sensory data of six IR sensors as well as the speed and alignment of the mobile agent with the predefined goal. After each iteration, the robot undergoes step movement to move to its immediate next sub-goal computing two control variables which are direction and speed. Thus it reaches its predefined goal. The precision of this work is proved by the fact that the robot's final destination through step movement ultimately coincides with the predefined goal. Moreover the performance of our approach for multiple mobile agents is found to have outperformed when compared to the classical heuristic and evolutionary techniques-based path planning strategies. The entire work has been implemented on Khepera II mobile robot. © 2012 IEEE."

This restriction gives rise to a natural notion of adjacency. We show that a language based on ordered types can use this property to give an exact account of the layout of data in memory. The fuse constructor from ordered logic describes adjacency of values in memory, and the mobility modal describes pointers into the heap. We choose a particular allocation model based on a common implementation scheme for copying garbage collection and show how this permits us to separate out the allocation and initialization of memory locations in such a way as to account for optimizations such as the coalescing of multiple calls to the allocator."

Postoperatively (i) the antihypertensive medication was reduced from five to two components and (ii) a permanent renal insufficiency with resulting need for dialysis was avoided. Even after a bypass occlusion triggered by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which had been given after another unrelated, non-vascular surgical intervention with successful local lysis, regular checks revealed a constantly stable renal function. Under specific circumstances, vascular surgical reconstruction is a suitable tool to retain the organ as well as to achieve an improvement in function. It also serves to reduce long-term effects of renal artery stenosis or of a specific type of occlusion. Conclusions: In general, revascularization/reconstruction is particularly indicated as an immediate measure in cases of a fresh occlusion or of a persisting residual perfusion of the renal parenchyma. The competent assessment is a very challenging task for the interdisciplinary vascular specialist in terms of interpreting appropriate clinical data and the results of medical imaging to decide whether an intervention is likely to be successful or not (partly because it is not unambiguous/cannot be objectified). With an optimized arterial perfusion (especially via the main renal artery) (i) retaining the kidney (preventive measure) and (ii) reestablishing renal function can be achieved. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013."

Product introduction within an extended enterprise demands close co-operation between different participants such as companies, departments, groups/teams, and individuals. The different participants' internal goals will influence the ability to attain a joint goal for the product introduction. This paper presents some of the different internal goals for product introduction, the conflicts that they can result in, and ways to overcome these. It is based on two case studies performed in two manufacturing extended enterprises in Sweden, one within the electronic industry and one within the mechanical engineering industry. The main conclusions are that working with product introduction within extended enterprises demands a trustful relation between the different participants and that it is extremely beneficial to involve production engineers as early as in the conceptual design phase for new products."

Two additional PCR-ELISA assays were developed to validate the results: one, based on the detection of the maize alcohol dehydrogenase 1 promoter specifically detected the presence of maize, and the other, based on the detection of a conserved sequence of plants (255 ribosomal RNA gene), validated the extracted DNA amplification. The PCR-ELISA assays developed here were highly specific and found to be as sensitive as the reference Southern hybridisation assay. The PCR-ELISA tests were at least 6 times more sensitive than gel electrophoresis and allowed 0.1% GMOs to be detected in Bt176, Bt11, Mon810 maize and Roundup Ready soybean. The PCR-ELISA tests are a method of choice for GMO screening and identifying Bt176 maize in flours and native starches.

In Study 1, semi-professional association football players completed questionnaire measures before and after a competitive match. In Study 2, student athletes completed questionnaire measures for two performance scenarios: one in which they were performing above their normal level and one in which they were performing below their normal level. Findings demonstrated that cognitive trait anxiety was associated with greater disruptions in concentration but was unrelated to mental effort. For state measures, athletes reported greater levels of concentration disruption when experiencing high levels of anxiety or high levels of happiness, and fewer disruptions in concentration when experiencing high levels of excitement. Findings also showed that excitement was associated with low levels of mental effort during good performances and high levels of mental effort during poor performances; anxiety and happiness were associated with high levels of mental effort during good performances and low levels of mental effort during poor performances. Taken together, these studies point towards potential benefits accompanying high levels of excitement and potential disadvantages accompanying high levels of anxiety and happiness. © 2013 Copyright European College of Sport Science."

The exact pathogenesis is not clear, but an involvement of factors such as bile duct compression by venous collaterals, ischemia, and infection is accepted by most authors. Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was used to define and diagnose this condition, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is currently the investigation of choice for diagnosing this condition. Treatment is indicated only for symptomatic cases. Portosystemic shunts are the treatment of choice for symptomatic portal biliopathy. In the majority of patients, the changes caused by biliopathy resolve after shunt surgery, however, 15%-20% patients require a subsequent bilio-enteric bypass or endoscopic management for persistent biliopathy.

We therefore analysed blooming dates over long periods at climate-contrasted sites in Western Europe, focusing mainly on the Golden Delicious apple that is grown worldwide. On average, blooming advances were more pronounced in northern continental (10 days) than in western oceanic (6-7 days) regions, while the shortest advance was found on the Mediterranean coastline. Temporal trends toward blooming phase shortenings were also observed in continental regions. These regional differences in temporal variability across Western Europe resulted in a decrease in spatial variability, i. e. shorter time intervals between blooming dates in contrasted regions (8-10-day decrease for full bloom between Mediterranean and continental regions). Fitted sequential models were used to reproduce phenological changes. Marked trends toward shorter simulated durations of forcing period (bud growth from dormancy release to blooming) and high positive correlations between these durations and observed blooming dates support the notion that blooming advances and shortenings are mainly due to faster satisfaction of the heating requirement. However, trends toward later dormancy releases were also noted in oceanic and Mediterranean regions. This could tend toward blooming delays and explain the shorter advances in these regions despite similar or greater warming. The regional differences in simulated chilling and forcing periods were consistent with the regional differences in temperature increases. © 2012 ISB."

2-s2.0-84874037073.xml,State of the art atmosphere plasma sources are operated with frequencies in kHz/MHz regions and all high power plasma jets make use of tungsten electrodes. A microwave plasma torch has been developed at FH Aachen for the application in various fields. The advantages over other plasma jet technologies are the high efficiency combined with a maintenance-free compact design and non-tungsten electrodes. In this paper the development of a 200 W torch is described. Argon is used as the primary plasma gas and a second gas can be applied for additional purposes. For the plasma generation a microwave at 2.45 GHz is sent through the torch. The special internal topology causes a high electric field that ignites the plasma at the tip and leads to the ionization of the passing Argon atoms which are emitted as a jet. By designing the copper electrode as a cannula it is possible to gain plasma temperatures higher than the electrode's melting point. The electric field simulations are made with Ansoft HFSS. Experiments were carried out to verify the simulations. The upcoming steps in the development will be the scale-up to higher power levels of several kW with a magnetron as power source.
2-s2.0-1642292283.xml,"Simulations in the authors' previous studies have shown that a modified temperature integration regime with a 6-day averaging period and increased set-point flexibility was able to reduce annual energy consumption by up to 9% as compared to a regular temperature integration regime. The commonly applied fixed set-point for relative humidity (RH) of 80-85% strongly reduced the potential for energy saving with this regime. Therefore, a more flexible humidity control regime was developed. Simulations indicated that yearly energy consumption could be reduced by 18% as compared to a fixed set-point of 80% RH. By combining the two regimes (temperature integration and humidity control), it was predicted that the energy saving would be even greater. To test this prediction, the combined regimes were applied in two experiments with cut-flower chrysanthemum crops investigating the effect on plant development and growth. Different temperature bandwidths for temperature integration (±2, ±4, ±6 and ±8°C) were also compared within the joint regime. Crop development was only delayed with the ±8°C temperature bandwidth. The best regime with respect to plant development, growth, quality and energy saving (±6°C temperature bandwidth) was compared in a spring experiment with a climate regime used in commercial practice. Energy consumption was 23.5% less with the joint regime. No negative consequences of high humidity were observed, but there was a strong increase in the dry weight of all plant organs. Total plant dry weight was 39% higher than in the regular regime. It can be concluded that energy saving and crop yield increase can be achieved simultaneously, although the dynamic temperature control has to be adjusted to the chrysanthemum developmental stage. The combined dynamic climate regime forms a promising basis for future climate controllers and is easily extendable to other greenhouse crops. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-1642418279.xml,"Every company makes choices about the channels it will use to go to market. Traditionally, the decision to sell through a discount superstore or a pricey boutique, for instance, was guided by customer demographics. A company would identify a target segment of buyers and go with the channel that could deliver them. It was a fair assumption that certain customer types were held captive by certain channels-if not from cradle to grave, then at least from initial consideration to purchase. The problem, the authors say, is that today's customers have become unfettered. As their channel options have proliferated, they've come to recognize that different channels serve their needs better at different points in the buying process. The result is ""value poaching."" For example, certain channels hope to use higher margin sales to cover the cost of providing expensive high-touch services. Potential customers use these channels to do research, then leap to a cheaper channel when it's time to buy. Customers now hunt for bargains more aggressively; they've become more sophisticated about how companies market to them; and they are better equipped with information and technology to make advantageous decisions. What does this mean for your go-to-market strategy? The authors urge companies to make a fundamental shift in mindset toward designing for buyer behaviors, not customer segments. A company should design pathways across channels to help its customers get what they need at each stage of the buying process-through one channel or another. Customers are not mindful of channel boundaries-and you shouldn't be either. Instead, they are mindful of the value of individual components in your channels-and you should be, too."

If fertility is maintained, there is a high risk of abnormal pregnancy outcome. Few male carriers have been identified by children presenting with mental retardation/congenital malformations (MR/CM) or by spontaneous abortions of the spouses. We report a de novo CCR with five breakpoints involving chromosomes 4, 10 and 14 in a male carrier who was ascertained through a son presenting with MR/CM due to an unbalanced karyotype with partial trisomy 14 and partial monosomy 4. The child has a healthy elder brother. In the family history no abortions were reported. No fertility treatment was necessary. Cytogenetic analysis from the affected son showed a reciprocal translocation t(4;10) with additional chromosomal material inserted between the translocation junctions in the derivative chromosome 10. The father showed the same derivative chromosome 10 but had additionally one aberrant chromosome 14. Further molecular cytogenetic analyses determined the inserted material in the aberrant chromosome 10 as derived from chromosome 14 and revealed a small translocation with material of chromosome 4 inserted into the derivative chromosome 14. Thus the phenotype of the son is supposed to be associated with a partial duplication 14q13→q24.1 and a partial monosomy 4q27→q28. Including our case we are aware of eleven CCR cases with fertile male carriers. In eight of these families normal offspring have been reported. We propose that exceptional CCRs in fertile male carriers might form comparatively simple pachytene configurations increasing the chance of healthy offspring. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel."

Engagement of these receptors leads to phosphorylation of their cytoplasmic tails and recruitment of the adapter proteins SLAM-associated protein (SAP) and Ewing's sarcoma-activated transcript-2 (EAT-2). X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) is a severe immunodeficiency that results from mutations in the SAP gene. 2B4 and NTB-A-mediated cytotoxicity are abrogated in XLP NK cells. To elucidate the molecular basis for this defect we analyzed early signaling events in SAP knockdown cells. Similar to XLP NK cells, knockdown of SAP in primary human NK cells leads to a reduction of 2B4 and NTB-A-mediated cytotoxicity. We found that early signaling events such as raft recruitment and receptor phosphorylation are not affected by the absence of SAP indicating the defect in the absence of SAP is downstream of these events. In addition, knockdown of EAT-2 does not impair 2B4 or NTB-A-mediated cytotoxicity.

In this report, we investigated the effect of colonic bacteria on epithelial cell differentiation factors in vitro and in vivo. As key transcription factors we focused on Hes1, known to direct towards an absorptive cell fate, Hath1 and KLF4, which govern goblet cell. Methods: Expression of the transcription factors Hes1, Hath1 and KLF4, the mucins Muc1 and Muc2 and the defensin HBD2 were measured by real-time PCR in LS174T cells following incubation with several heat-inactivated E. coli strains, including the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917+/- flagellin, Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. For protein detection Western blot experiments and chamber-slide immunostaining were performed. Finally, mRNA and protein expression of these factors was evaluated in the colon of germfree vs. specific pathogen free vs. conventionalized mice and colonic goblet cells were counted. Results: Expression of Hes1 and Hath1, and to a minor degree also of KLF4, was reduced by E. coli K-12 and E. coli Nissle 1917. In contrast, Muc1 and HBD2 expression were significantly enhanced, independent of the Notch signalling pathway. Probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 regulated Hes1, Hath1, Muc1 and HBD2 through flagellin. In vivo experiments confirmed the observed in vitro effects of bacteria by a diminished colonic expression of Hath1 and KLF4 in specific pathogen free and conventionalized mice as compared to germ free mice whereas the number of goblet cells was unchanged in these mice. Conclusions: Intestinal bacteria influence the intestinal epithelial differentiation factors Hes1, Hath1 and KLF4, as well as Muc1 and HBD2, in vitro and in vivo. The induction of Muc1 and HBD2 seems to be triggered directly by bacteria and not by Notch. © 2013 Becker et al."

It is particularly important to monitor the dynamics of ovarian follicles' growth, as only fully mature and grown follicles, i.e., the dominant follicles have a potential to ovulate at the end of a follicular phase. Gynaecologists follow this process in two dimensions, but recently three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound examinations are coming to the fore. This paper surveys the existing computer methods for detection, recognition, and analyses of follicles in two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D ovarian ultrasound recordings. Our study focuses on the efficiency, validation, and assessment of proposed follicle processing algorithms. The most important processing steps were identified in order to compare their performances.

Four of the indices used were biometeorological indices: thermal index, pre-flowering hydric index, dormancy hydric index and summer index; the fifth was an autoregressive cyclicity index based on pollen data from previous years. The extreme weather events characteristic of the Mediterranean climate were also taken into account by applying different adjustment criteria. The results obtained with this model were compared with those yielded by a traditional meteorological-based model built using multivariate regression analysis of simple meteorological-related variables. The performance of the models (confidence intervals, significance levels and standard errors) was compared, and they were also validated using the bootstrap method.

Quantitative proteomic analysis in metastatic renal cell carcinoma reveals a unique set of proteins with potential prognostic significance. Mol. Cell. Proteomics 12(1), 132-144 (2012). Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors, that are associated with a high potential of metastases. In the last decade proteomic technologies have been used in RCC research to improve the discovery of early diagnosis and prognosis markers. To investigate the potential of metastasizing RCC, Masui et al. performed differential quantitative proteomics using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation and compared the protein expression profile from metastatic RCCs to primary RCC. The authors could identify 29 proteins with different expression behaviors between the compared groups. Furthermore, with the help of hierarchical clustering, the authors could even establish a protein expression pattern that discriminates aggressive from nonaggressive RCC. A preliminary validation highlighted three potential prognosis markers Pfn1, 14-3-3ζ and Gal-1, increased expression of which correlated with poor outcomes. The authors concluded that a better understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying the expression changes of the identified proteins could deliver new insights into the therapy of metastatic RCC. © 2013 Expert Reviews Ltd."

2-s2.0-84874057966.xml,"SRAM-based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are vulnerable to soft-error. To improve circuit dependability, various dependable design techniques have been studied. By the same token, evaluation techniques are required to ensure dependability. The most popular evaluation technique is reconfiguration-based fault-injection (FI) analysis. However, most FI analyses are inadequate for the evaluation of a dependable circuit because they don't consider fault accumulation. The critical issue is the reconfiguration time for injecting many faults. This paper presents an FI analysis system using frame-based partial reconfiguration and a bootstrap method to accelerate evaluation. As a result, our system can accelerate FI time by about a factor of 5 - 10 relative to the full-reconfiguration FI system. Further, the number of reconfiguration times is reduced to one out of several dozen by applying the bootstrap method. © 2012 IEEE."

In San Francisco Bay, California, numbers of predators of western snowy plovers and the potential for recreation-based human disturbances have increased during the past few decades and will likely increase for the foreseeable future. In an attempt to increase the reproductive success of western snowy plovers, managers have dedicated considerable resources to management practices including predator removal and habitat enhancement projects in San Francisco Bay. The unequivocal identification of western snowy plover nest predators and information regarding the behavioral responses of nesting plovers to human disturbance would inform management practices for this species. Therefore, we examined the efficacy of using a digital video surveillance system to identify nest predators of western snowy plovers in former salt evaporation ponds in San Francisco Bay and to assess its potential for use in behavioral studies. This system was designed to minimize disturbance to nesting plovers and limit predator bias at breeding sites that had little or no cover to camouflage or protect the equipment. The system included a small camera with infrared lights placed approximately 20 m from nests and a continuously operating recording unit and power supply that was positioned up to 300 m from nests. The system could be deployed within 20 min, run continuously for up to 5 d, and data could be retrieved without disturbing nesting birds. During a 2-y study period, we recorded six species depredating plover eggs and chicks: red-tailed hawk Buteo jamaicensis, common raven Corvus corax, California gull Larus californicus, northern harrier Circus cyaneus, ruddy turnstone Arenaria interpres, and gray fox Urocyon cinereoargenteus. Our results suggest that this surveillance system was effective for identifying western snowy plover nest predators, and the presence of the camera did not influence nesting success of monitored nests. This system could be integrated into conservation programs intended to improve reproductive success of this species and could be useful for conducting behavioral studies of western snowy plovers and other species."

2-s2.0-84874216144.xml,"Attenuated vaccinia virus (VACV) vectors are considered prime vaccine candidates for use in immunotherapy of infectious disease. In spite of this, recent data show that the level of attenuation may hamper the efficient generation of protective CD8T cells. This suggests that additional adjuvant-like activities may need to be combined with attenuated VACV for optimal vaccination. Stimulatory reagents to theTNFR family molecule 4-1 BB (CD137) may represent such an adjuvant for vaccination. Previous murine studies have found that 4-1 BB can participate in optimal priming of effector and memory CD8 T cells in response to several virus infections, and concordantly direct stimulation of 4-1 BB with agonist reagents effectively boosts the CD8T cell response against those viruses. In contrast, we recently reported that 4-1 BB plays no role in the response to a virulent strain of VACV, questioning whether agonists of 4-1 BB will be useful adjuvants for vaccination with VACV vectors. Here we show that agonist anti-4-1 BB strongly enhanced the primary viral-specific effector CD8 T cell response during infection with live virulent VACV and attenuated VACV, and during immunization with VACV peptides given in I FA. However, accumulation of memory CD8 T cells was enhanced only following infection with virulentVACV or with peptide vaccination, but not with attenuated VACV, correlating in part with more transient expression of 4-1 BB on CD8 T cells with attenuated virus. Our data therefore suggest that 4-1 BB may be a promising candidate for targeting as an adjuvant for short-term enhancement of CD8T cell responses with VACV vaccine strategies, but additional receptors may need to be engaged with 4-1 BB to allow long-term CD8T cell immunity with attenuated VACV vectors. © 2012 Zhao, Tahiliani, Salek-Ardakani and Croft."

2-s2.0-1542347184.xml,"Model checking is an automated technique for verifying that a system satisfies a set of required properties. Such properties are typically expressed as temporal logic formulas, in which atomic propositions are predicates over state variables of the system. In event-based system descriptions, states are not characterized by state variables, but rather by the behavior that originates in these states in terms of actions. In this context, it is natural for temporal formulas to be built from atomic propositions that are predicates on the occurrence of actions. The paper identifies limitations in this approach and introduces ""fluent"" propositions that permit formulas to naturally express properties that combine state and action. A fluent is a property of the world that holds after it is initiated by an action and ceases to hold when terminated by another action. The paper describes an approach to model checking fluent-based linear-temporal logic properties, with its implementation and application in the LTSA tool."
2-s2.0-1542290172.xml,"This paper addresses the weighted anisotropic shortest-path problem on a continuous domain, i.e., the computation of a path between two points that minimizes the line integral of a cost-weighting function along the path. The cost-weighting depends both on the instantaneous position and direction of motion. We propose an algorithm for the computation of shortest-path that reduces the problem to an optimization over a finite graph. This algorithm restricts the search to paths formed by the concatenation of straight-line segments between points, from a suitably chosen discretization of the continuous region. To maximize efficiency, the discretization of the continuous region should not be uniform. We propose a novel ""honeycomb"" sampling algorithm that minimizes the cost penalty introduced by discretization. The resulting path is not optimal but the cost penalty can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computation. This methodology is applied to the computation of paths for groups of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) that minimize the risk of being destroyed by ground defenses. We show that this problem can be formulated as a weighted anisotropic shortest-path optimization and show that the algorithm proposed can efficiently produce low-risk paths."

The potential for occurrence of groundwater in the study areas was classified as very good, good, moderate, and poor by interpreting the subsurface geophysical investigations, namely vertical electrical soundings, were carried out to delineate potential water-bearing zones. The studies reveal that the groundwater potential of shallow aquifers is due to weathered zone very low resistivity and very high thickness and the potential of deeper aquifers is determined by fracture zone very low resistivity and very high thickness area.

The splits, represented as sparse weight vectors, are learned through an L-1-constrained optimization framework. The users are directed to child nodes according to the inner product of their responses and the corresponding weight vector.

However, many privately owned enterprises are in need of assistance, affected by internal capability constraints such as a lack of management and leadership skills and by an external environment that still privileges state-owned enterprises. Although policy makers may have had other policy priorities in the past, and private enterprises have been able to survive and grow without inputs of professional advice and support, we argue that in the future small and medium-sized enterprises in China will require appropriate and effective business support to continue to grow.

The resulting graphenes have a single thickness of one bilayer and consist of regular terraces separated by the triple SiC bilayer steps on the 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. In situ scanning tunneling microscopy reveals that suppression of pit formation on terraces and uniformity of SiC decomposition at step edges are the key factors to the uniform thickness. By studying the surface morphologies prepared under different annealing rates, it is found that the annealing rate is directly related to SiC decomposition, diffusion of the released Si/C atoms and strain relaxation, which together determine the final step structure and density of defects. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd."

Additionally, besides DSM Axis I conditions, cluster A and C personality disorders (PD), in particular schizoid, schizotypal and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders (OCPD) have been reported. However, the literature on this topic remains scarce. The aim of our preliminary investigation was to estimate the frequencies of DSM-IV axis I and II diagnoses and explore the psychosocial and occupational functioning in a group of ASDs adults with normal-intelligence consecutively referred to our centre. Methods: Participants were at least 16 years of age with possible highfunctioning (HF) ASDs referred to the Pavia Autism Laboratory (University of Pavia) or the Neuropsychiatry Unit of the Milan San Paolo Hospital. HF ASDs diagnostics included ADI-R, ADOS module 4, WAIS-R. The MINI Plus and the SCID-II were administered to investigate psychiatric comorbidities.

We have extended the CCured type inference algorithm to recognize and verify statically a large number of type casts; this goal is achieved by using physical subtyping and pointers with run-time type information to allow parametric and subtype polymorphism. In addition, we present a new instrumentation scheme that splits CCured's metadata into a separate data structure whose shape mirrors that of the original user data. This scheme allows instrumented programs to invoke external functions directly on the program's data without the use of a wrapper function.

METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to Dieulafoy's lesion (DL) from 2005 to 2011. We analyzed the demographic characteristics of the patients, risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, endoscopic findings, characteristics of the endoscopic treatment, and the recurrence of bleeding. We included cases in which endoscopy described a lesion compatible with Dieulafoy. We excluded patients who had potentially bleeding lesions such as angiodysplasia in other areas or had undergone other gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with DL were identified. Most of them were men with an average age of 71.5 years. Fifty-five percent of the patients received antiaggregatory or anticoagulant therapy. The most common location for DL was the stomach (51.7%). The main type of bleeding was oozing in 65.5% of cases. In 27.6% of cases, there was arterial (spurting) bleeding, and 6.9% of the patients presented with an adherent clot. A single endoscopic treatment was applied to nine patients (31%); eight of them with adrenaline and one with argon, while 69% of the patients received combined treatment. Six patients (20.7%) presented with recurrent bleeding at a median of 4 d after endoscopy (interquartile range = 97.75). Within these six patients, the new endoscopic treatment obtained a therapeutic success of 100%. The presence of arterial bleeding at endoscopy was associated with a higher recurrence rate for bleeding (50% vs 33.3% for other type of bleeding) [P = 0.024, odds ratio (OR) = 8.5, 95% CI = 1.13-63.87]. The use of combined endoscopic treatment prevented the recurrence of bleeding (10% vs 44.4% of single treatment) (P = 0.034, OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.19-0.99). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic treatment of DL is safe and effective. Adrenaline monotherapy and arterial (spurting) bleeding are associated with a high rate of bleeding recurrence. © 2012 Baishideng.

There is evidence that the reflectance spectra of many flowers target the distinctive visual discrimination abilities of hymenopteran insects, but far less is known about bird-pollinated flowers. Birds are hypothesized to exert different selective pressures on floral colour compared with hymenopterans because of differences in their visual systems. We measured the floral reflectance spectra of 206 Australian angiosperm species whose floral visitors are known from direct observation rather than inferred from floral characteristics. We quantified the match between these spectra and the hue discrimination abilities of hymenopteran and avian vision, and analysed these metrics in a phylogenetically informed comparison of flowers in different pollination groups. We show that bird-visited flowers and insect-visited flowers differ significantly from each other in the chromatic cues they provide, and that the differences are concentrated near wavelengths of optimal colour discrimination by whichever class of pollinator visits the flowers.

2-s2.0-1642298923.xml,"The ability of systems of molecular reactions to be simultaneously autocatalylic and sustained by some ambient 'food source' of simple molecules may have been an essential step in the origin of life. In this paper we first describe a polynomial-time algorithm that determines whether any given set of molecules, reactions and catalysations contains a subsystem that is both autocatalytic and able to be sustained from a given subset of the molecules. We also describe some combinatorial properties of this algorithm, and show how it can be used to find irreducible auto-catalysing and sustaining subsystems. In the second part of the paper we use the algorithm to investigate random catalytic networks - in particular, a model described by Kauffman. Using simulations and some analytic techniques we investigate the rate of catalysis that is required for the emergence of autocatalytic and sustaining subsystems. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-1642405249.xml,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of several inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Current cell-based assays for MCP-1 use monocyte chemotaxis or calcium flux as a readout. Here, we describe an alternative bioassay based on MCP-1-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p44 (ERK1) and p42 (ERK2). Adherent cells expressing the MCP-1 receptor CCR2B are treated with MCP-1 in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of inhibitors, fixed and permeabilized with methanol, and then probed with a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes the doubly phosphorylated form of p44/42 MAPK. Bound antibody is detected with a secondary antibody-peroxidase conjugate and a chromogenic substrate. The phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK as detected in this assay peaks after 3-5min of MCP-1 treatment, and the concentration of MCP-1 required for half-maximal p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation is 1-3nM. MCP-1-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK is dependent upon the expression of CCR2B. The assay can be used for screening and characterization of small molecule inhibitors and antibodies blocking the binding of MCP-1 to its receptor. Since the assay is rapid and simple, it may represent a useful alternative to chemotaxis or calcium mobilization assays for the analysis of MCP-1 inhibitors. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Energy demand, life cycle cost and home qualities are assessed as sustainability indicators. The Façade renovation strategy is an energy upgrade of the façade supplemented with high renewable energy production on site. The Ambitious renovation strategy is a total building envelope upgrade using passive house components and a lower on site renewable energy production. Both renovation strategies result in a 50-85% reduction of the heating requirement depending on the renewable energy production. The sustainability assessment was done as an iterative process including qualitative and quantitative parameters. The Ambitious renovation strategy is more costly than the Façade alternative over a 30 year period. However, homeowners do not base their decisions to renovate strictly on cost evaluations and homeowner categories influence the assessment. The Façade strategy is suitable for homeowners that do the retrofit themselves and homeowners prioritizing to keep the existing architectural qualities of their house. The Ambitious strategy is more suitable for the homeowners seeking to change the aesthetics of their home as well as for the homeowners emphasizing the overall technical performance after renovation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

The use of nanoparticles for biomedical applications is particularly exciting due to their huge potential for multi-modal approaches. This includes their use as drug delivery vectors, imaging contrast agents, hyperthermia systems and molecular targeting. Their ability to cross biological barriers, for example the blood brain barrier, makes them attractive for potential treatments in neurological disorders. There is also great hope that nanostructures will serve as platforms in future cancer therapies. Current cancer fighting strategies consist primarily of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Each of these treatments is bound by a limit, known as the therapeutic window, which, if exceeded, causes undue harm to the patient. In the ongoing quest to improve our therapeutic arsenal, nanoparticles are emerging as exciting structures for a new generation of multi-modal therapeutics. Within this context, carbon nanostructures are amongst the leading contenders as building blocks to deliver multi-function drug delivery platforms. This review examines the various properties of carbon nanostructures that allow such multi-functionality. Recent advances on the development of novel approaches for functionalization, targeting and imaging via carbon nanostructures are discussed. This journal is © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

Design/methodology/approach: A survey with responses from 606 SMEs in the North West European peripheral regions was administered. The survey explores the role of a range of business improvement methods (BIM/TQM) as an antecedent or stimulant in helping to achieve three levels of effective innovation implementation: introducing new products/services; engaging in innovation that resulted in major product/service innovation (radical), and engaging in innovation activities that did not result in major product innovation (incremental), and non-innovative. Findings: The findings show that BIM/TQM was likely to stimulate and encourage the development of incremental levels of innovation in the SMEs where there was an emphasis on the people, or organic aspects of BIM/TQM applied, rather than more mechanistic BIM/TQM approaches. However, there was a lack of a clear link between BIM/TQM and radical innovation where newness in products/services and markets was required.

In the MAAS, any drawdown of groundwater head in an aquifer may cause consolidation of the overburden aquitard. When underground structures penetrate those aquifers, groundwater seepage path changes and drawdown occurs at the side characterized by the lower hydraulic potential along the flow direction (hereafter refers as to the lower side). This drawdown may cause additional subsidence at the lower side and unbalanced load between the two sides of the underground structure. In order to evaluate the cutoff effect of an underground structure on groundwater seepage in a MAAS representative of the underground of the city of Shanghai, a numerical analysis based on a groundwater flow model has been carried out. The simulated results have shown that underground structures which cut off groundwater flow locally change both magnitude and direction of the flow velocity field. The induced changes in the groundwater field are highly sensitive to the penetration depth and width of the underground structure.

Design/methodology/approach: The design of the study is based on literature review and multiple case studies. Combining both approaches and investigating a spectrum of 37 European SMEs through 232 semi-structured and face-to-face interviews with managers helped the authors to provide theoretical and empirical evidence to offer a more effective performance management process for SMEs. Findings: The paper found that SMEs engage with a four-stage performance management process, although there are some gaps between their practice and the complete process as recommended in literature. SMEs seem to be more focussed on internal and short-term planning, whereas they pay less attention to long-term planning. The main challenge for making performance management practice more effective lies in an appropriate, balanced use of strategic and operational practices and relevant measures. Therefore, managerial activities such as vision, mission and values development, internal and external communication, change management and horizon scanning represent recommended areas for improvement.

In the multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind arm, 48 subjects received intravenous infusions of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam at 600/600 mg every 12 h (q12h), 400/400 mg q8h, 900/900 mg q12h, 600/600 mg q8h, or placebo for 10 days. Ceftaroline and avibactam levels in plasma and urine were measured by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. No significant differences in systemic exposure of ceftaroline or avibactam were observed when the drugs were administered alone versus concomitantly, indicating that there was no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between ceftaroline fosamil and avibactam administered as a single dose. No appreciable accumulation of either drug occurred with multiple intravenous doses of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam, and pharmacokinetic parameters for ceftaroline and avibactam were similar on days 1 and 10. Infusions of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam were well tolerated at total daily doses of up to 1,800 mg of each compound, and all adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in severity. Infusion-site reactions were the most common AEs reported with multiple dosing.

The failure of such a transformer is a matter of significant concern for electrical utilities, not only for the consequent severe economic losses, but also because the utility response to a customer during outage condition is one of the major factors in determining the overall customer attitude towards the utility. Therefore, it is essential to estimate the thermal state of transformers during load cycling and, in presence of overload conditions, to evaluate the need to reduce the load current or to install another transformer bay. A method of solving the transformer's thermal model, considering explicitly the source of uncertainly affecting its parameters, is required.

2-s2.0-84874103122.xml,"Background: The ability to use erythritol as a sole carbon source is not universal among the Rhizobiaceae. Based on the relatedness to the catabolic genes in Brucella it has been suggested that the eryABCD operon may have been horizontally transferred into Rhizobium. During work characterizing a locus necessary for the transport and catabolism of erythritol, adonitol and L-arabitol in Sinorhizobium meliloti, we became interested in the differences between the erythritol loci of S. meliloti and R. leguminosarum. Utilizing the Ortholog Neighborhood Viewer from the DOE Joint Genome Institute database it appeared that loci for erythritol and polyol utilization had distinct arrangements that suggested these loci may have undergone genetic rearrangements. Results: A data set was established of genetic loci containing erythritol/polyol orthologs for 19 different proteobacterial species. These loci were analyzed for genetic content and arrangement of genes associated with erythritol, adonitol and L-arabitol catabolism. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for core erythritol catabolic genes and contrasted with the species phylogeny. Additionally, phylogenetic trees were constructed for genes that showed differences in arrangement among the putative erythritol loci in these species. Conclusions: Three distinct erythritol/polyol loci arrangements have been identified that reflect metabolic need or specialization. Comparison of the phylogenetic trees of core erythritol catabolic genes with species phylogeny provides evidence that is consistent with these loci having been horizontally transferred from the alpha-proteobacteria into both the beta and gamma-proteobacteria. ABC transporters within these loci adopt 2 unique genetic arrangements, and although biological data suggests they are functional erythritol transporters, phylogenetic analysis suggests they may not be orthologs and probably should be considered analogs. Finally, evidence for the presence of paralogs, and xenologs of erythritol catabolic genes in some of the genomes included in the analysis is provided. © 2013 Geddes et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."
2-s2.0-1542291791.xml,"Apart from control of the seizures, two of the most important factors in determining how well a child with epilepsy progresses toward independence are cognition and behavior. The diagnosis of the correct epilepsy syndrome often provides information with regard to probability of good seizure control and intellectual outcome. However, relatively little has been published on the behavioral aspects of the various epilepsy syndromes. In West syndrome there is emerging evidence that early effective treatment might improve outcome in terms of both cognition and behavior. The work on this syndrome in children with tuberous sclerosis has demonstrated an association between temporal lobe tubers and autism. In Dravet syndrome, a variety of psychiatric disorders have been reported, including hyperactivity and autistic features. This is another epilepsy syndrome that tends to be resistant to treatment, implying that the prognosis has to be guarded. The behavioral problems reported with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome also include autistic features, as well as generally sluggish behavior. It is very likely that these characteristics largely reflect the effect of ongoing seizure activity. Autistic features, aggression, and hyperkinesis have been described with Landau-Kleffner syndrome. The behavior may improve dramatically with appropriate medical treatment or after multiple subpial transection. Although the syndrome of benign partial seizures with centrotemporal or rolandic spikes is said to have a very good prognosis, it is becoming increasingly evident that behavioral problems such as concentration difficulties, tempers, hyperactivity, and impulsivity might occur. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy has been associated with very variable behavioral traits, sometimes with immature personality features and poor social adjustment suggesting frontal lobe dysfunction. Because many of the reports of behavioral disturbance associated with epilepsy syndromes are anecdotal and do not include validated measures of behavior it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions from them at this stage. Carefully conducted prospective studies, paying particular attention to any behavioral improvements that occur with successful treatment of the epilepsy, are required. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The precision and accuracy of the newly developed NMR methods are compared with those of currently employed ASTM D-5291 combustion method. Using the proton NMR method, hydrogen content was determined in fifteen model compounds and sixty-eight petroleum fractions. The NMR and ASTM methods show an agreement within ±5% for 48 out of a total number of 68 oil fractions. Using carbon-13 NMR, the carbon content was determined for four representative compounds and three fractions of crude oil. Both carbon-13 NMR and ASTM methods give comparable carbon content in model compounds and crude oil fractions."

2-s2.0-84873914743.xml,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been recognized as a major health burden. It is the most important cause of chronic liver disease and a major independent cardiovascular risk factor. Lacking a definite treatment for NAFLD, a specific diet and an increase in physical activity represent the most commonly used therapeutic approaches. In this review, major literature data about the use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) as a potential treatment of NAFLD have been described. n-3 PUFAs, besides having a beneficial impact on most of the cardio-metabolic risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis) by regulating gene transcription factors [i.e., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α, PPARγ, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein], impacts both lipid metabolism and on insulin sensitivity. In addition to an enhancement of hepatic beta oxidation and a decrease of the endogenous lipid production, n-3 PUFAs are able to determine a significant reduction of the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) and of oxygen reactive species. Further strengthening the results of the in vitro studies, both animal models and human intervention trials, showed a beneficial effect of n-3 PUFAs on the severity of NAFLD as expressed by laboratory parameters and imaging measurements. Despite available results provided encouraging data about the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs as a treatment of NAFLD in humans, welldesigned randomized controlled trials of adequate size and duration, with histological endpoints, are needed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of PUFA, as well as other therapies, for the treatment of NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients. It is worthwhile to consider that n-3 PUFAs cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be derived from exogenous sources (fish oil, flaxseeds, olive oil) which are typical foods of the Mediterranean diet, known for its beneficial effects in preventing obesity, diabetes and, in turn, cardiovascular events. According to these data, it is important to consider that most of the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs can also be obtained by an equilibrate nutrition program. © 2012 Baishideng.

This increase in data volume provides new opportunities for solar researchers, but the efficient processing and analysis of these data create new challenges. We introduce a fuzzy-based solar feature-detection system in this article. The proposed system processes SDO/AIA images using fuzzy rules to detect coronal holes and active regions. This system is fast and it can handle different size images. It is tested on six months of solar data (1 October 2010 to 31 March 2011) to generate filling factors (ratio of area of solar feature to area of rest of the solar disc) for active regions and coronal holes. These filling factors are then compared to SDO/EVE/ESP irradiance measurements. The correlation between active-region filling factors and irradiance measurements is found to be very high, which has encouraged us to design a time-series prediction system using Radial Basis Function Networks to predict ESP irradiance measurements from our generated filling factors. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

The fuse constructor from ordered logic describes adjacency of values in memory, and the mobility modal describes pointers into the heap.

Resolvin D series (RvDs) and E series (RvEs), protectins, and maresins (MaRs) are endogenous omega-3 fatty acid-derived lipid mediators (LMs) that potently promote inflammation resolution by shortening neutrophil life span and promoting macrophage (Mf) non-phelogistic phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and the subsequent exit of Mfs from inflammatory tissue. 14S, 21R-dihydroxy docosahexaenoic acid (14S, 21R-diHDHA), a Mf-produced autacrine, reprograms Mfs to rescue vascular endothelia. RvD1, RvE1, or 14S, 21 R-diHDHA also switches Mfs to the phenotype that produces pro-resolving interleukin-10. RvDs or protectin/neuroprotectin D1 (PD1/NPD1) inhibits neutrophil infiltration into injured kidneys, blocks toll-like receptor -mediated inflammatory activation of Mfs and mitigates renal functions. RvDs also repress renal interstitial fibrosis, and PD1 promotes renoprotective heme-oxygenase-1 expression.

2-s2.0-84874042646.xml,"Background: The central molecule in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to be a small-sized polypeptide - beta amyloid (Aβ) which has an ability to assemble spontaneously into oligomers. Various studies concerning therapeutic and prophylactic approaches for AD are based on the immunotherapy using antibodies against Aβ. It has been suggested that either active immunization with Aβ or passive immunization with anti-Aβ antibodies might help to prevent or reduce the symptoms of the disease. However, knowledge on the mechanisms of Aβ-induced immune response is rather limited. Previous research on Aβ1-42 oligomers in rat brain cultures showed that the neurotoxicity of these oligomers considerably depends on their size. In the current study, we evaluated the dependence of immunogenicity of Aβ1-42 oligomers on the size of oligomeric particles and identified the immunodominant epitopes of the oligomers. Results: Mice were immunized with various Aβ1-42 oligomers. The analysis of serum antibodies revealed that small Aβ1-42 oligomers (1-2 nm in size) are highly immunogenic. They induced predominantly IgG2b and IgG2a responses. In contrast, larger Aβ1-42 oligomers and monomers induced weaker IgG response in immunized mice. The monoclonal antibody against 1-2 nm Aβ1-42 oligomers was generated and used for antigenic characterization of Aβ1-42 oligomers. Epitope mapping of both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies demonstrated that the main immunodominant region of the 1-2 nm Aβ1-42 oligomers is located at the amino-terminus (N-terminus) of the peptide, between amino acids 1 and 19. Conclusions: Small Aβ1-42 oligomers of size 1-2 nm induce the strongest immune response in mice. The N-terminus of Aβ1-42 oligomers represents an immunodominant region which indicates its surface localization and accessibility to the B cells. The results of the current study may be important for further development of Aβ-based vaccination and immunotherapy strategies. © 2013 Dalgediene et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

2-s2.0-84873969859.xml,"The recently introduced ion trap for FT-ICR mass spectrometers with dynamic harmonization showed the highest resolving power ever achieved both for ions with moderate masses 500-1000 Da (peptides) as well as ions with very high masses of up to 200 kDa (proteins). Such results were obtained for superconducting magnets of very high homogeneity of the magnetic field. For magnets with lower homogeneity, the time of transient duration would be smaller. In superconducting magnets used in FT-ICR mass spectrometry the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field in its axial direction prevails over the inhomogeneity in other directions and should be considered as the main factor influencing the synchronic motion of the ion cloud. The inhomogeneity leads to a dependence of the cyclotron frequency from the amplitude of axial oscillation in the potential well of the ion trap. As a consequence, ions in an ion cloud become dephased, which leads to signal attenuation and decrease in the resolving power. Ion cyclotron frequency is also affected by the radial component of the electric field. Hence, by appropriately adjusting the electric field one can compensate the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field and align the cyclotron frequency in the whole range of amplitudes of z-oscillations. A method of magnetic field inhomogeneity compensation in a dynamically harmonized FT-ICR cell is presented, based on adding of extra electrodes into the cell shaped in such a way that the averaged electric field created by these electrodes produces a counter force to the forces caused by the inhomogeneous magnetic field. © 2012 American Society for Mass Spectrometry."

There have been no studies to determine how and to what extent this teaching is done in physical medicine and rehabilitation training programs. Objective: To assess the state of medical-ethics teaching in Canadian physical medicine and rehabilitation residency training programs. Methods: A six-question survey was faxed to the program directors of the 10 physiatry residency training programs in Canada. We asked whether medical-ethics teaching is being done, who is doing the teaching, which pedagogic methods is used, how many hours are dedicated to the topic, which topics are taught, and what evaluation method is used. Results: The response rate was 90 per cent. The study confirmed that medical-ethics teaching is done in all Canadian physiatry training programs. However, the person doing the teaching, the number of hours allocated to ethics education, the pedagogic method used, and the topics being taught vary from program to program. Conclusion: Although medical-ethics teaching is done in all programs, there is a need for more standardization in the curriculum and in evaluation. The curriculum should focus on ethical issues that are most likely to be encountered in daily physiatric practice. Small-group, case-based teaching should be used for maximum effectiveness.

This study investigated the formation of strontium carbonated hydroxyapatite nanoparticles from an amorphous phase. Crystallization of carbonated hydroxyapatite occurred at 585 °C, but samples with an intended 25% and 75% replacement of calcium with strontium crystallized at 624 °C. Heat treatment at the crystallization temperature revealed that strontium free apatite does not crystallize in 5 minutes, but an increasing strontium concentration leads to a higher rate of crystallization. X-ray diffraction patterns suggest that it may be difficult to include strontium, but higher strontium concentrations are possibly included with ease in the lattice. This work has produced a nanosized apatite accompanied by an amorphous phase after a short heat-treatment time.

2-s2.0-84874251943.xml,"The study of P transposable element repression in Drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of the trans-silencing effect (TSE), a homology-dependent repression mechanism by which a P-transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequences) represses in trans, in the female germline, a homologous P-lacZ transgene inserted in euchromatin. TSE shows variegation in ovaries and displays a maternal effect as well as epigenetic transmission through meiosis. In addition, TSE is highly sensitive to mutations affecting heterochromatin components (including HP1) and the Piwi-interacting RNA silencing pathway (piRNA), a homology-dependent silencing mechanism that functions in the germline. TSE appears thus to involve the piRNA-based silencing proposed to play a major role in P repression. Under this hypothesis, TSE may also be established when homology between the telomeric and target loci involves sequences other than P elements, including sequences exogenous to the D. melanogaster genome. We have tested whether TSE can be induced via lacZ sequence homology. We generated a piggyBac-otu-lacZ transgene in which lacZ is under the control of the germline ovarian tumor promoter, resulting in strong expression in nurse cells and the oocyte. We show that all piggyBac-otu-lacZ transgene insertions are strongly repressed by maternally inherited telomeric P-lacZ transgenes. This repression shows variegation between egg chambers when it is incomplete and presents a maternal effect, two of the signatures of TSE. Finally, this repression is sensitive to mutations affecting aubergine, a key player of the piRNA pathway. These data show that TSE can occur when silencer and target loci share solely a sequence exogenous to the D. melanogaster genome. This functionally supports the hypothesis that TSE represents a general repression mechanism which can be co-opted by new transposable elements to regulate their activity after a transfer to the D. melanogaster genome. © 2012 Pöyhönen et al."

However, recent studies reveal that NETs exert adverse effects in a number of diseases including those of the lung. Many inflammatory lung diseases are characterized with a massive influx of neutrophils into the airways. Neutrophils contribute to the pathology of these diseases. To date, NETs have been identified in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF), acute lung injury (ALI), allergic asthma, and lungs infected with bacteria, virus, or fungi. These microbes and several host factors can stimulate NET formation, or NETosis. Different forms of NETosis have been identified and are dependent on varying types of stimuli. All of these pathways however appear to result in the formation of NETs that contain DNA, modified extracellular histones, proteases, and cytotoxic enzymes. Some of the NET components are immunogenic and damaging to host tissue. Innate immune collectins, such as pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D), bind NETs, and enhance the clearance of dying cells and DNA by alveolar macrophages. In many inflammatory lung diseases, bronchoalveolar SP-D levels are altered and its deficiency results in the accumulation of DNA in the lungs. Some of the other therapeutic molecules under consideration for treating NET-related diseases include DNases, antiproteases, myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitors, peptidylarginine deiminase-4 inhibitors, and anti-histone antibodies. NETs could provide important biological advantage for the host to fight against certain microbial infections. However, too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.

2-s2.0-84873931030.xml,"Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be grouped as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These conditions have become increasingly common in recent years, including in children and young people. Although much is known about aspects of the pathogenesis of these diseases, the precise aetiology is not yet understood, and there remains no cure. Recent data has illustrated the importance of a number of genes-several of these are important in the onset of IBD in early life, including in infancy. Pain, diarrhoea and weight loss are typical symptoms of paediatric Crohn's disease whereas bloody diarrhoea is more typical of colitis in children. However, atypical symptoms may occur in both conditions: these include isolated impairment of linear growth or presentation with extra-intestinal manifestations such as erythema nodosum. Growth and nutrition are commonly compromised at diagnosis in both Crohn's disease and colitis. Consideration of possible IBD and completion of appropriate investigations are essential to ensure prompt diagnosis, thereby avoiding the consequences of diagnostic delay. Patterns of disease including location and progression of IBD in childhood differ substantially from adultonset disease. Various treatment options are available for children and adolescents with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition plays a central role in the induction of remission of active Crohn's disease. Medical and surgical therapies need to considered within the context of a growing and developing child. The overall management of these chronic conditions in children should include multi-disciplinary expertise, with focus upon maintaining control of gut inflammation, optimising nutrition, growth and quality of life, whilst preventing disease or treatment-related complications. © 2012 Baishideng.

In two studies, we focus on emotional carrying capacity (ECC), wherein relationship partners express more of their emotions, express both positive and negative emotions, and do so constructively, as a source of resilience in individuals and in teams. Study 1's findings indicate that ECC is positively related to individual resilience and that ECC mediates the link between relationship closeness and individual resilience. Study 2's findings indicate a similar pattern for resilience at the team level: ECC is positively related to team resilience and mediates the connection between trust and team resilience. Together, these studies provide insight into how emotional expression in relationships is a key mechanism in explaining resilience, a foundational element for the pursuit of long-term virtuousness for individuals and for teams. © 2013 NTL Institute."

Most publications describe interferon α-induced sarcoidosis. However, HCV infection per se is also suggested to cause sarcoidosis. The present case report describes a case of biopsy-verified lung and liver sarcoidosis and HCV infection, and the outcome of antiviral therapy. In March 2009, a 25-year-old man presented with moderately elevated liver enzymes without any clinical symptoms. The patient was positive for HCV antibodies and HCV RNA of genotype 1b. Four months later the patient became dyspnoic and pulmonary sarcoidosis was diagnosed by lung biopsy and radiography. A short course of corticosteroid treatment relieved symptoms. Three months later, liver biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas consisting of epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells with a small amount of peripheral lymphocyte infiltration, without any signs of fibrosis. Chronic HCV infection with coexistence of pulmonary and hepatic sarcoidosis was diagnosed. Antiviral therapy with peginterferon α and ribavirin at standard doses was started, which lasted 48 wk, and sustained viral response was achieved. A second liver biopsy showed disappearance of granulomas and chest radiography revealed normalization of mediastinal and perihilar glands. The hypothesis that HCV infection per se may have triggered systemic sarcoidosis was proposed. Successful treatment of HCV infection led to continuous remission of pulmonary and hepatic sarcoidosis. Further studies are required to understand the relationship between systemic sarcoidosis and HCV infection. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved."

This information is then used to generate the new arms race prediction: differences in genitalic form among congeneric species in which females are protected should be less common than differences among congeneric species in which females are vulnerable to harassment by males. This prediction was tested using a sample of 361 genera of insects and spiders. The prediction clearly failed, even when the data were adjusted to take into account several possible biases. Comparative analyses within particular taxonomic groups also failed to show the predicted trends, as did less extensive data on other non-genitalic male display traits. Arms races, as defined in some recent models, seem to have been less important in male-female coevolution of genitalic structures than has been suggested. By elimination, alternative interpretations, such as traditional female choice, which do not predict associations between female protection from harassment and rapid divergent evolution, are strengthened."

The degradation of gluten proteins during fermentation may, however, crucially alter the gluten network formation. We observed changes that occurred in the HMW glutenins during wheat sourdough fermentations. As fermentation starters, we used either rye sourdough or pure cultures of lactobacilli and yeast. In addition, we incubated wheat flour (WF) in the presence of antibiotics under different pH conditions. The proteolytic activities of cereal and sourdough-derived proteinases were studied with edestin and casein. During sourdough fermentations, most of the highly polymerized HMW glutenins degraded. A new area of alcohol-soluble proteins (≈30.000 MW) appeared as a result of the proteolytic breakdown of gluten proteins. Very similar changes were observable as WF was incubated in the presence of antibiotics at pH 3.7. Cereal and sourdough-derived proteinases hydrolyzed edestin at pH 3.5 but showed no activity at pH 5.5. An aspartic proteinase inhibitor (pepstatin A) arrested 88-100% of the activities of sourdough enzymes. According to these results, the most active proteinases in wheat sourdoughs were the cereal aspartic proteinases. Acidic conditions present in sourdoughs create an ideal environment for cereal aspartic proteinases to be active against gluten proteins."

First, Tmrt is determined and the so-called UTCI-Fiala model is then used for the calculation of UTCI. Taking into account the uncertainties of NWP model (among others the HIgh Resolution Limited Area Model HIRLAM) output (temperature, downwelling short-wave and long-wave radiation) stated in the literature, we simulate and discuss the uncertainties of Tmrt and UTCI at three stations in different climatic regions of Europe. The results show that highest negative (positive) differences to reference cases (under assumed clear-sky conditions) of up to -21°C (9°C) for Tmrt and up to -6°C (3. 5°C) for UTCI occur in summer (winter) due to cloudiness. In a second step, the uncertainties of RCM simulations are analyzed: three RCMs, namely ALADIN (Aire Limitée Adaptation dynamique Développement InterNational), RegCM (REGional Climate Model) and REMO (REgional MOdel) are nested into GCMs and used for the prediction of temperature and radiation fluxes in order to estimate Tmrt and UTCI. The inter-comparison of RCM output for the three selected locations shows that biases between 0. 0 and ±17. 7°C (between 0. 0 and ±13. 3°C) for Tmrt (UTCI), and RMSE between ±0. 5 and ±17. 8°C (between ±0. 8 and ±13. 4°C) for Tmrt (UTCI) may be expected. In general the study shows that uncertainties of UTCI, due to uncertainties arising from calculations of radiation fluxes (based on NWP models) required for the prediction of Tmrt, are well below ±2°C for clear-sky cases. However, significant higher uncertainties in UTCI of up to ±6°C are found, especially when prediction of cloudiness is wrong. © 2012 ISB."

Emulsions close to the binodal line as well as far from it have been investigated. It is shown that above a critical shear rate, shear-induced mixing occurs at the length scales probed by the laser light. It is hypothesized that the shear-induced homogenization is due to the shear forces that exceed the intermolecular forces of the self-association process of the gelatin. The isothermal phase diagram at a fixed shear rate has been determined. In addition, the structure evolution after cessation of flow has been studied. When flow is stopped after homogenization, phase separation occurs almost instantaneously. When subsequently applying a low shear rate, the structure coarsens due to coalescence of the dispersed droplets.

Methods: A literature review was performed to identify large trials assessing the impact of glycaemic control on risk of macrovascular disease. Inclusion and exclusion criteria from each trial were applied to data on the population of people with a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes living in Scotland in 2008 (n = 180 590) in a population-based cross-sectional study and the number and proportion of people eligible for each trial was determined. Results: Seven trials were identified. The proportion of people with Type 2 diabetes who met the eligibility criteria for the trials ranged from 3.5 to 50.7%. Trial participants were younger at age of diagnosis of diabetes and at time of trial recruitment than in the Scottish study population. The application of upper age criteria excluded the largest proportion of patients, with up to 39% of people with Type 2 diabetes ineligible for a trial with the most stringent criteria based on age alone. Conclusions: We found that many of the large trials of glycaemic control among people with Type 2 diabetes have limited external validity when applied to a population-based cohort of people with Type 2 diabetes. In particular, the age distribution of trial participants often does not reflect that of people with Type 2 diabetes in a contemporary British population. © 2012 Diabetes UK."

Clinically the results presented in this study suggest that the stiffness of the back support surfaces found in many hospitals may be sub-optimal and that a backboard or a concrete floor can be used to enhance CC effectiveness. In addition, the choice of optimal CC rate and maximum sternal force applied by clinicians during peak force CPR is ought to be based on a general assessment of the patient's thoracic stiffness, taking into account the patient's age, gender, and physical condition; which is consistent with current clinical practice. In addition, it is important for clinicians to note that very high peak sternal forces, exceeding the limit above which severe chest wall trauma and abdominal injury occurs, may be required for optimal CC during peak force CPR on patients with very stiff chests.

2-s2.0-84874115773.xml,"Reversible data hiding has been a hot research topic because it can recover both the host media and hidden data without distortion. Because most digital images are stored and transmitted in compressed forms, such as JPEG, vector quantization, and block truncation coding (BTC), the reversible data hiding schemes in compressed domains have been paid more and more attention. Compared with transform coding, BTC has a significantly low complexity and less memory requirement, it therefore becomes an ideal data hiding domain. Traditional data hiding schemes in the BTC domain modify the BTC encoding stage or BTC-compressed data according to the secret bits, and they have a relatively low efficiency and meanwhile may reduce the image quality. This paper presents a novel reversible data hiding scheme based on the joint neighbor coding technique for BTC-compressed images by further losslessly encoding the BTC-compressed data according to the secret bits. First, BTC is performed on the original image to obtain the BTC-compressed data that can be represented by a high mean table, a low mean table, and a bitplane sequence. Then, the secret data are losslessly embedded in both the high mean and low mean tables. Our hiding scheme is a lossless method based on the relation among the current value and the neighboring ones in mean tables. In addition, it can averagely embed 2 bits in each mean value, which increases the capacity and efficiency. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms three existing BTC-based data hiding works, in terms of the bit rate, capacity, and efficiency. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited."

These rocks mainly belong to Siwalik system suffered by many structural disturbances. The stability assessment of the area is very critical to avoid and manage further damage to surrounding agricultural land as well as population along the river. The slopes' failures increase the siltation, reduce carrying capacity of the river with time and further increase the water level on the bank of the slope. The slope was simulated using two modelling methods, namely limit equilibrium method and finite element method. Results indicate that the stress is mostly confined in the terrace above the basement in all the cases, where the factor of safety is almost unity.

2-s2.0-84873921482.xml,"AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of human thrombin in the treatment of bleeding gastric and ectopic varices. METHODS: Retrospective observational study in a Tertiary Referral Centre. Between January 1999-October 2005, we identified 37 patients who were endoscopically treated with human thrombin injection therapy for bleeding gastric and ectopic varices. Patient details including age, gender and aetiology of liver disease/ segmental portal hypertension were documented. The thrombin was obtained from the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and prepared to give a solution of 250 IU/mL which was injected via a standard injection needle. All patient case notes were reviewed and the total dose of thrombin given along with the number of endoscopy sessions was recorded. Initial haemostasis rates, rebleeding rates and mortality were catalogued along with the incidence of any immediate complications which could be attributable to the thrombin therapy. The duration of follow up was also listed. The study was conducted according to the United Kingdom research ethics guidelines. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included. 33 patients (89%) had thrombin (250 U/mL) for gastric varices, 2 (5.4%) for duodenal varices, 1 for rectal varices and 1 for gastric and rectal varices. (1) Gastric varices, an average of 15.2 mL of thrombin was used per patient. Re-bleeding occurred in 4 patients (10.8%), managed in 2 by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) (one unsuccessfully who died) and in other 2 by a distal splenorenal shunt; (2) Duodenal varices (or type 2 isolated gastric varices), an average of 12.5 mL was used per patient over 2-3 endoscopy sessions. Re-bleeding occurred in one patient, which was treated by TIPSS; and (3) Rectal varices, an average of 18.3 mL was used per patient over 3 endoscopy sessions. No re-bleeding occurred in this group. CONCLUSION: Human thrombin is a safe, easy to use and effective therapeutic option to control haemorrhage from gastric and ectopic varices. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved."

Identifying predicting factors of short-term survival in patients with AMI may play an important role in reducing mortality in these patients. Methods: In this cohort study, all patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admitted to all hospitals in Isfahan, Iran, during 2000-2008 which registered in Isfahan cardiovascular research Institute were analyzed. We used Cox regression models, uni- and multi-variable analysis. Results: Within the study period, 8800 AMI patients (73.6% male) were admitted with mean age of 61.85±12.5, and overall 28-day survival of 90.5%. Relative risk (RR) of death for 50-70 years old patients was 2.5 (CI:2-3.1), for over 70 years old RR=5 (CI:4-6.3), for women RR=1.7 (CI:1.5-1.9), for patients who had not received streptokinase RR=0.9 (CI:0.8-1.1), for inferior MI RR=4.2 (CI:2.2-7.8) and for anterior MI, RR was equal to 7.2 (CI:4-13.3). Conclusion: Recognizing the predicting factors of short-term survival of AMI patients may help health professionals to provide better healthcare services for more at risk patients, i.e. elderly, women and patients with an anterior MI."

2-s2.0-1442348279.xml,"Objectives: To describe the clinical presentation and course of a relatively large group of Italian adult patients screened for mutation of the homogentisate dioxygenase gene causing alkaptonuria (AKU) and ochronosis, and to review typical and atypical facets of this condition. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 9 patients affected by ochronotic arthropathy who were observed in our institutions between 1979 and 2001. All patients were diagnosed as having AKU through a rapid urine test with alkali. Mutation screening was performed by single-strand conformation analysis of all homogentisate dioxygenase exons, followed by sequencing of altered conformers. Results: Our 9 cases had similar clinical features and they reflected those described in the literature: a progressive degenerative arthropathy mainly affecting axial and weight-bearing joints associated with extraarticular manifestation. Musculoskeletal symptoms began in most of our patients around the age of 30 years with back pain and stiffness: involvement of the large peripheral joints usually occurred several years after spinal changes. Ochronotic peripheral arthropathy generally was degenerative, but joint inflammation was observed in some cases; this could be attributed to an inflammatory reaction of the ochronotic shard in the synovial membrane. Conclusions: Ochronosis is a model of arthropathy with known etiologic factors. Over time, AKU, the genetically determined metabolic defect, leads to the accumulation of pigment and the development of this crippling condition. Most of the clinical findings may be explained by inhibition of collagen crosslinks, but some require additional interpretation. For example, inflammatory features of the ochronotic joint only occur in a minority of cases, and may be attributable to ochronotic shards. Further studies are needed to establish the genotype-phenotype correlation to identify mutations that are predictive of severe disease. For this purpose, the Italian Study Group on Alkaptonuria (www.dfc.unifi.it/aku) is enrolling affected patients in an on-line database to characterize the molecular defects and their relationship to clinical data. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Experience using experimental test benches has shown the importance of humidifying air stream used to induce vibration in excised larynges. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge particularly regarding the physicochemical properties of laryngeal mucus. The purpose of this study was to research vocal fold vibration in excised larynges using artificial mucus of precisely known viscosity. Eight freshly harvested porcine larynges were examined. Parameters measured were Fo and vocal fold contact time. Measurements were performed under three conditions: basal (no fluid application on vocal cord surface), after application of a fluid of 60cP viscosity (Visc60), and after application of a fluid of 100cP viscosity (Visc 100). Electroglottographic measurements were performed at two different times for each condition: 1 s after airflow onset (T1) and 6 seconds after airflow onset (T2). Statistical analysis consisted of comparing data obtained under each condition at T1 and T2. The results showed a significant decrease in Fo after application of Visc60 and Visc100 fluids and a decrease in Fo at T2. Closure time was significantly higher under Visc60 conditions and under Visc100 conditions than under basal conditions. Application of artificial mucus to the mucosa of the vocal folds lowered vibratory frequency and prolonged the contact phase. Our interpretation of this data is that the presence of mucus on the surface of the vocal folds generated superficial tension and caused adhesion, which is a source of nonlinearity in vocal vibration."

The objective of this study was to investigate psychotropic medication use among children and adolescents treated in system of care communities, to identify subject characteristics associated with psychotropic medication use, and determine whether psychotropic medication use is associated with reduced symptom severity. Methods: Data were collected through the National Evaluation of the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program. For this evaluation, 27 system of care communities reported data on medication use and clinical ratings at intake and 6-month follow-up on children and adolescents 6-18 years of age receiving mental health services between 2006 and 2009. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to determine associations between patient characteristics and medication use, and mixed-effects linear regression to determine whether subjects taking medication and those not taking medication experienced different changes in symptom severity between intake and 6 months. Results: Subject characteristics associated with psychotropic medication use, when controlling for other characteristics, included having more severe emotional and behavioral symptoms at intake, having more co-occurring diagnoses, and receiving more than one type of service. Those both taking and not taking medication showed symptom reduction at 6 months, although symptom severity among subjects taking medication remained in the clinical range. When controlling for covariates, symptom reduction was associated with medication use. Conclusion: Taking psychotropic medication was more strongly associated with measures of illness severity - greater symptom severity at intake, more co-occurring diagnoses, and more service intensity - than with other demographic characteristics. Subjects who took medication showed more symptom reduction at 6 months than those not taking medication, although this reduction was not sufficient to normalize symptoms among those taking medication. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

2-s2.0-84874136424.xml,"Background: Salmonella are important human and animal pathogens. Though highly related, the Salmonella lineages may be strictly adapted to different hosts or cause different diseases, from mild local illness like gastroenteritis to fatal systemic infections like typhoid. Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of Salmonella is essential for timely and correct diagnosis of Salmonella infections. The current identification methods such as 16S rRNA sequencing and multilocus sequence typing are expensive and time consuming. Additionally, these methods often do not have sufficient distinguishing resolution among the Salmonella lineages. Methodologies/Principal Findings: We compared 27 completely sequenced Salmonella genomes to identify possible genomic features that could be used for differentiation of individual lineages. We concatenated 2372 core genes in each of the 27 genomes and constructed a neighbor-joining tree. On the tree, strains of each serotype were clustered tightly together and different serotypes were unambiguously separated with clear genetic distances, demonstrating systematic genomic divergence among the Salmonella lineages. We made detailed comparisons among the 27 genomes and identified distinct sets of genomic differences, including nucleotide variations and genomic islands (GIs), among the Salmonella lineages. Two core genes STM4261 and entF together could unambiguously distinguish all Salmonella lineages compared in this study. Additionally, strains of a lineage have a common set of GIs and closely related lineages have similar sets of GIs. Conclusions: Salmonella lineages have accumulated distinct sets of mutations and laterally acquired DNA (e.g., GIs) in evolution. Two genes entF and STM4261 have diverged sufficiently among the Salmonella lineages to be used for their differentiation. Further investigation of the distinct sets of mutations and GIs will lead to novel insights into genomic evolution of Salmonella and greatly facilitate the elucidation of pathogeneses of Salmonella infections. © 2013 Zou et al."

METHODS: This is a single-center comparative effectiveness pilot study. Polyps (n = 103) from 75 averagerisk adult outpatients undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy between December 1, 2010 and April 1, 2011 were evaluated by two participating endoscopists in an academic outpatient endoscopy center. Polyps were evaluated both with high-definition white light and with i-SCAN to make an in vivo prediction of adenomatous vs non-adenomatous pathology. We determined diagnostic characteristics of i-SCAN and highdefinition white light, including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, with regards to identifying adenomatous vs non-adenomatous polyps. Histopathologic diagnosis was the gold standard comparison. RESULTS: One hundred and three small polyps, detected from forty-three patients, were included in the analysis. The average size of the polyps evaluated in the analysis was 3.7 mm (SD 1.3 mm, range 2 mm to 8 mm). Formal histopathology revealed that 54/103 (52.4%) were adenomas, 26/103 (25.2%) were hyperplastic, and 23/103 (22.3%) were other diagnoses include ""lymphoid aggregates"", ""non-specific colitis,"" and ""no pathologic diagnosis."" Overall, the combined accuracy of endoscopists for predicting adenomas was identical between i-SCAN (71.8%, 95%CI: 62.1%-80.3%) and high-definition white light (71.8%, 95%CI: 62.1%-80.3%). However, the accuracy of each endoscopist differed substantially, where endoscopist A demonstrated 63.0% overall accuracy (95%CI: 50.9%-74.0%) as compared with endoscopist B demonstrating 93.3% overall accuracy (95%CI: 77.9%-99.2%), irrespective of imaging modality. Neither endoscopist demonstrated a significant learning effect with i-SCAN during the study. Though endoscopist A increased accuracy using i-SCAN from 59% (95%CI: 42.1%-74.4%) in the first half to 67.6% (95%CI: 49.5%-82.6%) in the second half, and endoscopist B decreased accuracy using i-SCAN from 100% (95%CI: 80.5%-100.0%) in the first half to 84.6% (95%CI: 54.6%-98.1%) in the second half, neither of these differences were statistically significant.

2-s2.0-1442301827.xml,"Alkaline conditions are generally preferred for sanitization of chromatography media by cleaning-in-place (CIP) protocols in industrial biopharmaceutical processes. The use of such rigorous conditions places stringent demands on the stability of ligands intended for use in affinity chromatography. Here, we describe efforts to meet these requirements for a divalent proteinaceous human serum albumin (HSA) binding ligand, denoted ABD*dimer. The ABD*dimer ligand was constructed by genetic head-to-tail linkage of two copies of the ABD* moiety, which is a monovalent and alkali-stabilized variant of one of the serum albumin-binding motifs of streptococcal protein G. Dimerization was performed to investigate whether a higher HSA-binding capacity could be obtained by ligand multimerization. We also investigated the influence on alkaline stability and HSA-binding capacity of three variants (VDANS, VDADS and GGGSG) of the inter-domain linker. Biosensor binding studies showed that divalent ligands coupled using non-directed chemistry demonstrate an increased molar HSA-binding capacity compared with monovalent ligands. In contrast, equal molar binding capacities were observed for both types of ligands when using directed ligand coupling chemistry involving the introduction and recruitment of a unique C-terminal cysteine residue. Significantly higher molar binding capacities were also detected when using the directed coupling chemistry. These results were confirmed in affinity chromatography binding capacity experiments, using resins containing thiol-coupled ligands. Interestingly, column sanitization studies involving exposure to 0.1 M NaOH solution (pH 13) showed that of all the tested constructs, including the monovalent ligand, the divalent ligand construct containing the VDADS linker sequence was the most stable, retaining 95% of its binding capacity after 7 h of alkaline treatment."
2-s2.0-84873915138.xml,"Natural variation in organ morphologies can have adaptive significance and contribute to speciation. However, the underlying allelic differences responsible for variation in organ size and shape remain poorly understood. We have utilized natural phenotypic variation in three Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes to examine the genetic basis for quantitative variation in petal length, width, area, and shape. We identified 23 loci responsible for such variation, many of which appear to correspond to genes not previously implicated in controlling organ morphology. These analyses also demonstrated that allelic differences at distinct loci can independently affect petal length, width, area or shape, suggesting that these traits behave as independent modules. We also showed that ERECTA (ER), encoding a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like serine-threonine kinase, is a major effect locus determining petal shape. Allelic variation at the ER locus was associated with differences in petal cell proliferation and concomitant effects on petal shape. ER has been previously shown to be required for regulating cell division and expansion in other contexts; the ER receptor-like kinase functioning to also control organ-specific proliferation patterns suggests that allelic variation in common signaling components may nonetheless have been a key factor in morphological diversification. © 2013 Abraham et al."

Furthermore, we compare the proposed approach to another method for keypoint pruning based on saliency maps. The two approaches are evaluated using ground truth datasets. The evaluation shows that the proposed classification-based approach outperforms the adversary in terms of the trade-off between the matching recall and the percentage of reduced keypoints. Additionally, the evaluation demonstrates the ability of the proposed approach of effectively reducing the matching runtime. © 2012 IEEE."

While this bio-geographical configuration is critical for host biological processes, it imposes a risk for microbial penetration and life-threatening systemic invasion. Inflammasomes are cytosolic multi-protein platforms that sense both microbial and damage-associated molecular patterns and initiate a potent innate immune anti-microbial response. In this review, we will highlight the role of inflammasomes in the orchestration and regulation of the intestinal immune response, focusing on the roles of inflammasomes in maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, enteric infection, auto-inflammation, and tumorigenesis. We highlight the centrality of inflammasome signaling in the complex cross-talk between host mucosal immune arms and the environment, in particular the microflora, with emphasis on the spatial and temporal integration of inflammasome activation with signals from other innate signaling platforms. © 2013 Society for Mucosal Immunology."

2-s2.0-1442287515.xml,"The comparative analysis of scientific heritage of Richard Goldschmidt and Julian Huxley shows convincingly the resemblance of these two scientists' views over the core problems of evolutionary theory, genetics and development biology. They both contributed to developing a triad ""genetics - development - evolution"". The problem of a relative growth of animals was the central point in both Goldschmidt's and Huxley's works. Huxley developed a formula of the allometric growth (law of constant differential growth) while Goldschmidt was the first to draw up the broad interpretation of the consequences of that phenomenon. Both scientists belonged to initiators of development genetics and used the ""non-morganian"" genetics in their efforts of solving problems of macroevolution. Goldschmidt tended toward an idea of an important role of macromutation in the process of macroevolution, though Huxley adhered to more moderate views. But at the same time the concept of preadaptive mutations proposed by Huxley was close to Goldschmidt's idea of macromutants. It is shown that both scientists analyzed profoundly the changes in early stages of embryogenesis in respect to macroevolution. It is not likely to be reasonable to oppose firmly Goldschmidt's saltationism to the evolutionary synthesis of Huxley. They developed the lager biological problems in a similar way, and undoubtedly their works in the field helped to enrich the development of the views over genetics and evolution. The open-minded analysis of Goldschmidt's and Huxley's concepts leads to creating modern and up-to-date views over the theory of evolution where seemingly incompatible things go together rather well and supplement each other.

During apoptosis, translation undergoes significant down-regulation that correlates with caspase-3 mediated cleavage of several translation factors, including eIF4G, 4EBP1 and eIF2α. The fate of PABP in apoptotic cells has not yet been examined. Here we show that PABP levels decline significantly via proteolytic degradation in apoptotic HeLa, Jurkat and MCF7 cells. The degradation of PABP correlated with translation inhibition but lagged behind cleavage of eIF4GI. In apoptotic MCF7 cells translation inhibition occurred without modification of most translation factors and correlated with PABP degradation. PABP was not cleaved during incubation with several caspases, yet caspase 3 induced weak PABP degradative activity in cells lysates. Both the caspase inhibitor zVAD and calpain inhibitors blocked PABP cleavage in vivo, while the proteosome inhibitor MG132 induced PABP degradation. Protease(s) activated during apoptosis preferentially degraded PABP associated with ribosomes and translation factors, but not PABP in other cellular compartments. The data suggest that targeted degradation of PABP contributes to translation inhibition in apoptotic cells."

Second, and maybe even more importantly, we raise the question if the choice of a filing route is correlated with the probability of a patent filing being granted, withdrawn or refused in the examination process.To analyse those questions, we constructed a dataset consisting of nearly two million patent filings at the EPO between the priority years 1985 and 2008 based on the "" EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database"" (PATSTAT), differentiated by filing country, technological sector and the type of applicant.Our descriptive and multivariate results show that Euro-PCT and EPO first filings have gained increased importance since 1985 and are most often used by EPC member states. However, national offices remain important, especially for MNEs who mostly claim national priority first before filing at the EPO.

2-s2.0-84873909810.xml,"In most mammals, each hair follicle undergoes a cyclic process of growing, regressing and resting phases (anagen, catagen, telogen, respectively) called the hair cycle. Various biological factors have been reported to regulate or to synchronize with the hair cycle. Some factors involved in the extracellular matrix, which is a major component of skin tissue, are also thought to regulate the hair cycle. We have focused on an enzyme that degrades elastin, which is associated with skin elasticity. Since our previous study identified skin fibroblast elastase as neprilysin (NEP), we examined the fluctuation of NEP enzyme activity and its expression during the synchronized hair cycle of rats. NEP activity in the skin was elevated at early anagen, and decreased during catagen to telogen. The expression of NEP mRNA and protein levels was modulated similarly. Immunostaining showed changes in NEP localization throughout the hair cycle, from the follicular epithelium during early anagen to the dermal papilla during catagen. To determine whether NEP plays an important role in regulating the hair cycle, we used a specific inhibitor of NEP (NPLT). NPLT was applied topically daily to the dorsal skin of C3H mice, which had been depilated in advance. Mice treated with NPLT had significantly suppressed hair growth. These data suggest that NEP plays an important role in regulating the hair cycle by its increased expression and activity in the follicular epithelium during early anagen. © 2013 Morisaki et al."

The aim of the prospectively designed study was to assess whether the concentration of apoptotic markers apoptosis-stimulating fragment (Fas, CD95/APO-1) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) can predict prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Methods: The concentrations of soluble Fas and TRAIL were determined in 295 patients with acute coronary syndromes. The status of all patients was evaluated at 6 months. The primary goal was a composite end-point of death and hospitalization for heart failure. The secondary end-points were re-MI, death alone and stroke alone. Results: During the median follow-up of 6 months, 26 patients experienced the composite end-point. Using multivariate logistic regression, the concentration of TRAIL was the strongest significant and independent predictor of composite end-point (OR 0.11 (95% CI 0.03-0.45), p = 0.002). Low concentration was associated with poor prognosis of patients. Other significant predictors of composite end-point were serum creatinine (OR 7.7 (95% CI 1.1-54.5, p = 0.041) and complete revascularization (OR 0.19 (95% CI 0.05-0.78, p = 0.02). Independent significant predictors of death in the multivariate analysis were the concentration of TRAIL (OR 0.053 (95% CI 0.004-0.744), p = 0.029), older age (OR 1.20 (95% CI 1.02-1.41, p = 0.026) and serum creatinine (OR 15.1 (95% CI 1.56-145.2), p = 0.0193). Re-MI or stroke could not be predicted by any combination of obtained parameters. Conclusions: Low concentrations of soluble TRAIL represent a strong predictor of a poor prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

This alteration of Tregs function can furthermore be observed between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, which may have both clinical and therapeutical consequences. Chronic mucosal inflammation may also influence Tregs function, which together with the intestinal bacterial flora seem to have a supporting role in colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis.

In human subjects, antibody responses to Brugia malayi Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) are most often correlated with antibody responses to the L3 stage of B. malayi. Analysis of anti-WSP responses induced in mice by different stages of the rodent filariae Litomosoides sigmodontis shows that the strongest anti-WSP response is elicited by the L3 stage. Although adult filarial nematode death may play a role in the generation of an anti-WSP response, it is the L3 stage that is the major source of immunogenic material, and incoming L3 provide a continual boosting of the anti-WSP response.

Middle-class activists define their activism as a career, and their narratives depict a sequential and linear path to a new somewhat professionalized identity. Working-class activists conceive of their activism as a calling, and their narratives move backwards and forwards to an activism that links to and reinvents their working-class roots. Low-income activists make little distinction between their nonactivist and activist lives. They regard their activism as a way of life, and their related narratives combine episodes of collective action with stories of economic deprivation.

2-s2.0-84874105225.xml,"Aims: In intestinal inflammation the gut microbiota induces an innate immune response by activating epithelial and immune cells that initiate or maintain inflammation. We investigated whether the microbiota also can activate local microvascular cells and induce angiogenesis. Methods: Human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC) and human intestinal fibroblasts (HIF) were exposed to bacterial ligands specific for Toll-like receptor (TLR)2/6 and 4, and NOD1 and NOD2, and cell proliferation, migration, transmigration, tube formation, and production of pro-angiogenic factors were measured. The ability of the ligands to induce ex vivo vessel sprouting in an aortic ring assay and in vivo angiogenesis using a collagen gel assay also were assessed. Results: Bacterial ligands induced proliferation, migration, transmigration, tube formation of HIMEC, vessel sprouting, and in vivo angiogenesis; they also stimulated production of angiogenic factors from HIMEC and HIF, and HIF-derived angiogenic factors promoted HIMEC proliferation. To various degrees, all ligands induced angiogenic responses, but these were ligand- and cell type-dependent. Responses were mediated through receptor interacting protein-2 (RIP2)- and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-dependent signaling, involved the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways and the up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Knockdown of RIP2 and TRAF6 by RNA interference and neutralization of interleukin-8, basic fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibited TLR-/NOD-like receptor-induced HIMEC angiogenesis. Conclusions: The gut microbiota can selectively activate mucosal endothelial and mesenchymal cells to promote specific angiogenic responses in a TLR- and NOD-like receptor-dependent fashion.

An orbital ultrasound showed enlargement of soft tissue in the region of the left trochlea consistent with trochleitis. Treatment with prednisone and multiple local injections of corticosteroids and analgesic nerve blocks failed to relieve her symptoms. The patient subsequently experienced right trochleitis, and 2 years after the onset of her initial symptoms, she developed systemic symptoms and signs that led to a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Systemic immunosuppressive therapy was instituted, and the patient experienced marked relief in her ophthalmic symptoms. This case is unique in that not only bilateral sequential trochleitis was the presenting feature of SLE but also the ocular manifestations preceded the systemic manifestations of SLE by over 2 years. © 2012 by North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society."

Its formal semantics, graphical nature and expressiveness lend itself as a convenient model of computation for a wide-range of applications. On the other hand, Alloy is a declarative specification language used for expressing structural constraints and behavior in a software system. Alloy is heavily influenced by the Z notation on its mathematical aspects and Object Constraint Language on its syntax. An advantage of Alloy, however, is that its semantics bridges the gap between Z and object models, and shows how to give simple and robust meaning to widely used forms, such as navigation expressions and object model diagrams. This paper demonstrates how Petri nets and its properties and behavior can be specified using Alloy. © 2012 IEEE."

Our aim is to test at first for no effect of the model, i.e., the nullity of the functional coefficient. A fully automatic permutation test based on the cross covariance operator of the predictor and the response is proposed. The model can be, in an obvious way, extended to the case of several functional predictors. When testing for no effect of some covariate on the response the permutation test is no longer valid. An alternative pseudo-likelihood ratio test statistic is then introduced. The procedure can be applied in some way to test partial nullity of a functional coefficient.

An interdisciplinary team was established for planning the compounding activities addressed to patients with rare diseases and to realize «guidelines» for the production and distribution to patient of drugs. Material and Methods. The main activities of the group were: to define a list of orphan drugs usually produced by hospital pharmacies of the network; their classification with regional code, ATC code; price establishment according to the national tariff; definition and writing of a handbook and formulary of rare diseases. Results. Twenty hospital pharmacies joined the inter-regional network, and accepted to cross-cheek merge the records of their compounding activities into an handbook with 56 preparations for 30 rare diseases. Both the manual and the formulary are available for all doctors and pharmacists who work on rare diseases on the website http://intranet.ruparpiemonte.it. Conclusion. The availability of a manual and a form for rare diseases allows standardizing procedures, making orphan drugs available.

An enteric-coated formulation of mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS; myfortic®) has been developed with the aim of improving the upper GI tolerability of mycophenolic acid. Therapeutic equivalence of EC-MPS (720 mg b.i.d.) and MMF (1000 mg MMF b.i.d.), with concomitant cyclosporine microemulsion (Neoral®) and corticosteroids, was assessed in 423 de novo kidney transplant patients recruited to a 12-month, double-blind study. Efficacy failure (biopsy-proven acute rejection [BPAR], graft loss, death or loss to follow up) at 6 months (EC-MPS 25.8% vs. MMF 26. 2%; 95% CI: [-8.7, + 8.01) demonstrated therapeutic equivalence. At 12 months, the incidence of BPAR, graft loss or death was 26.3% and 28.1%, and of BPAR alone was 2 2.5% and 24.3% for EC-MPS and MMF, respectively. Among those with BPAR, the incidence of severe acute rejection was 2.1% with EC-MPS and 9.8% with MMF (p = ns). The safety profile and incidence of GI adverse events were similar for both groups.

Clinical pathological classifications are unable to predict the individual risk of recurrence and the prognosis which would also appear to be linked to additional factors, which have yet to be properly assessed, such as the genetic endowment of the tumour. In this study we assessed how microsatellite and chromosomal instability may help us to stratify two classes of risk of recurrence in patients at the same stage. From July 1996 to June 1999 we prospectively collected data on 112 patients (59 male, 53 female) affected by colorectal cancer and undergoing surgery with a radical intent. Biopsies of normal and tumor tissue were submitted to DNA extraction and amplification to evaluate the presence of chromosomal instability (loss of heterozygosity) and microsatellite instability. Analysis of the data revealed that loss of heterozygosity in the long arm of chromosome 18 is associated, in patients with stage III colorectal cancer, with a higher risk of recurrence and therefore with a worse prognosis. Microsatellite instability proved to be associated with a better prognosis even in cases of recurrence."

Methods: QoL issues relating to ED were generated through in-depth quali-tative interviews of 29 patients, literature review and consultation with other healthcare professionals. The issues were formulated into a questionnaire, which was piloted using 40 patients with ED and subsequently refined using well-established principles of questionnaire development. Results: The qualitative interviews revealed numerous psychosocial problems associated with ED, which were operationalised into a 40-item questionnaire. Pilot testing allowed the questionnaire to be reduced to a manageable 15-item final questionnaire while maintaining face and content validity and the potential to discriminate between men with varying degrees of affected QoL. This questionnaire had a Cronbach's α of 0.94. Conclusions: A new ED-specific QoL measure has been developed using appropriate methodology. Qualitative techniques identified a range of psychosocial morbidity in men with ED, leading to a simple but robust instrument with face and content validity. This questionnaire, Erectile Dysfunction - Effect on quality of life (ED-EQoL), has now undergone psychometric testing for validity and reliability."
2-s2.0-84874078380.xml,"Vaccination is the primary strategy for prevention and control of influenza. The surface hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza virus contains two structural elements (head and stalk) that differ in their potential utility as vaccine targets. The head of the HA protein is the primary target of antibodies that confer protective immunity to influenza viruses. The underlying health status, age, and gene polymorphisms of vaccine recipients and, just as importantly, the extent of the antigenic match between the viruses in the vaccine and those that are circulating modulate influenza vaccine protection. Vaccine adjuvants and live attenuated influenza vaccine improve the breadth of immunity to seasonal and pandemic virus strains. Eliciting antibodies against the conserved HA stem region that cross-react with HAs within influenza virus types or subtypes would allow for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. The highly complex network of interactions generated after influenza infection and vaccination can be studied with the use of systems biology tools, such as DNA microarray chips. The use of systems vaccinology has allowed for the generation of gene expression signatures that represent key transcriptional differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic host responses to influenza infection. Additionally, the use of systems vaccinology tools have resulted in the identifi cation of novel surrogate gene markers that are predictors of the magnitude of host responses to vaccines, which is critical to both vaccine development and public health. Identifying associations between variations in vaccine immune responses and gene polymorphisms is critical in the development of universal influenza vaccines.

2-s2.0-84874164768.xml,"Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), typically utilizing 254 nm radiation from low pressure mercury vapor lamps, is being applied in HVAC systems to inactivate infectious airborne microorganisms in health care, security, and general air quality applications. Simulation can play a useful role in the design of application-appropriate systems. A key requirement for accurate modeling is consideration for the impact on lamp UV output of the temperature and velocity of the air stream to which it is exposed. Lamp output varies greatly with the vapor pressure of the plasma it contains, which is highly dependent upon lamp surface cold spot temperature. A model of a single zone HVAC system serving an office space was constructed and was used to simulate the effects of UVGI device location, weather conditions, filter efficiency, and operating cycle on control of generic vegetative bacteria-like and fungal spore-like air contaminants. UVGI device modeling included a model of variable lamp output based on predicted average lamp surface temperature. It was found that lamp output could vary by more than 50% across the range of conditions considered with variations in average contaminant concentration during occupied hours as large as 13%. Operation of UVGI only during occupied hours produced similar occupied hour concentration to continuous operation, but much larger unoccupied hour concentrations. Filtration was found to complement UVGI well by removing the larger spore-like contaminant for which UVGI was less effective than for bacteria. © 2008 ASHRAE."

2-s2.0-84874003985.xml,"Background: The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) is a not-for profit organization committed to providing affordable medicines and access to treatments in resource-poor settings. Traditionally drug development has happened ""in house"" within pharmaceutical companies, with research and development costs ultimately recuperated through drug sales. The development of drugs for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases requires a completely different model that goes beyond the scope of market-driven research and development. Artesunate and mefloquine are well-established drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, with a strong safety record based on many years of field-based studies and use. The administration of such artemisinin-based combination therapy in a fixed-dose combination is expected to improve patient compliance and to reduce the risk of emerging drug resistance. Case description. DNDi developed an innovative approach to drug development, reliant on strong collaborations with a wide range of partners from the commercial world, academia, government institutions and NGOs, each of which had a specific role to play in the development of a fixed dose combination of artesunate and mefloquine. Discussion and evaluation. DNDi undertook the development of a fixed-dose combination of artesunate with mefloquine. Partnerships were formed across five continents, addressing formulation, control and production through to clinical trials and product registration, resulting in a safe and efficacious fixed dose combination treatment which is now available to treat patients in resource-poor settings. The south-south technology transfer of production from Farmanguinhos/Fiocruz in Brazil to Cipla Ltd in India was the first of its kind. Of additional benefit was the increased capacity within the knowledge base and infrastructure in developing countries. Conclusions: This collaborative approach to drug development involving international partnerships and independent funding mechanisms is a powerful new way to develop drugs for tropical diseases. © 2013 Wells et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Materials and methods: Between February 2001 and December 2010, 171 consecutive HHT patients (95 men and 76 women) were studied with triphasic multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in 91 cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 34 cases and both in the remaining 46 cases. The presence of diffuse vascular abnormalities and focal liver lesions were recorded. Results: Hepatic arteriovenous malformations (HAVMs) were found in 126/171 (74%) patients. Arteriovenous shunts were found in 24/171 (14%) cases, arterioportal shunts in 52/171 (30%), mixed shunts in 26/171 (15%), telangiectases in 84/171 (49%) and transient hepatic attenuation differences (THADs) in 70/171 (41%). Hepatic nodular lesions were found in 6/171 (3.5%) patients (three men; three women). In 5/6 cases, vascular abnormalities were also evident. Two patients had a single lesion; four had multiple lesions. No lesion showed a central scar. Conclusions: Hyperenhancing hepatic regenerative lesions have a high prevalence in HHT patients, representing the response of liver parenchyma to hypoperfusion caused by HAVMs. These lesions are often multiple and may lead to nodular regenerative hyperplasia. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Italia."
2-s2.0-84873920243.xml,"This study investigates the mechanisms by which the ocean diurnal cycle can affect the ocean mean state in the North Atlantic region. We perform two ocean-atmosphere regionally coupled simulations (20°N-80°N, 80°W-40°E) using the CNRMOM1D ocean model coupled to the ARPEGE4 atmospheric model: one with a 1. h coupling frequency (C1h) and another with a 24. h coupling frequency (C24h). The comparison between both experiments shows that accounting for the ocean diurnal cycle tends to warm up the surface ocean at high latitudes and cool it down in the subtropics during the boreal summer season (June-August). In the subtropics, the leading cause for the formation of the negative surface temperature anomalies is the fact that the nocturnal entrainment heat flux overcompensates the diurnal absorption of solar heat flux. Both in the subtropics and in the high latitudes, the surface temperature anomalies are involved in a positive feedback loop: the cold (warm) surface anomalies favour a decrease (increase) in evaporation, a decrease (increase) in tropospheric humidity, a decrease (increase) in downwelling longwave radiative flux which in turn favours the surface cooling (warming). Furthermore, the decrease in meridional sea surface temperature gradient affects the large-scale atmospheric circulation by a decrease in the zonal mean flow. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."
2-s2.0-84873989355.xml,"Climate change in the last three decades could have major impacts on crop phenological development and subsequently on crop productivity. In this study, trends in winter wheat phenology are investigated in 36 agro-meteorological stations in the North China Plain (NCP) for the period 1981-2009. The study shows that the dates of sowing (BBCH 00), emergence (BBCH 10) and dormancy (start of dormancy) are delayed on the average by 1. 5, 1. 7 and 1. 5 days/decade, respectively. On the contrary, the dates of greenup (end of dormancy), anthesis (BBCH 61) and maturity (BBCH 89) occur early on the average by 1. 1, 2. 7 and 1. 4 days/decade, respectively. In most of the investigated stations, GP2 (dormancy to greenup), GP3 (greenup to anthesis) and GP0 (entire period from emergence to maturity) of winter wheat shortened during the period 1981-2009. Due, however, to early anthesis, grain-filling stage occurs at lower temperatures than before. This, along with shifts in cultivars, slightly prolongs GP4 (anthesis to maturity). Comparison of field-observed CERES (Crop Environment Resource Synthesis)-wheat model-simulated dates of anthesis and maturity suggests that climate warming is the main driver of the changes in winter wheat phenology in the NCP. The findings of this study further suggest that climate change impact studies should be strengthened to adequately account for the complex responses and adaptations of field crops to this global phenomenon. © 2012 ISB."
2-s2.0-84874222837.xml,"Recently, there has been some discussion of whether it is possible to score highly in one dimension of physical activity behaviour (e.g., moderate intensity exercise) whilst also scoring poorly in another (e.g., sedentary time). Interestingly, direct empirical observations to support these proposals are lacking. New technologies now enable the capture of physical activity thermogenesis on a minute-by-minute basis and over a sustained period. We used one of the best available technologies to explore whether individuals can score differently in various physiologically-important physical activity dimensions. We determined minute-by-minute physical activity energy expenditure over 7 days in 100 men aged 28±9 years. We used combined accelerometry and heart rate with branched equation modelling to estimate energy expenditure and extracted data for key physical activity outcomes and descriptors. Although some physical activity outcomes were tightly correlated, the attainment of one threshold for a given physical activity dimension did not automatically predict how well an individual scored in another dimension (with bivariate correlations ranging from 0.05 to 0.96). In one illustrative example of this heterogeneity, although 41 men showed a relatively low Physical Activity Level (total energy expenditure/resting energy expenditure ≤1.75), only 17% (n = 7) of these men showed consistently low physical activity across other dimensions (moderate intensity activity, vigorous intensity activity, and sedentary time). Thus, physical activity is highly heterogeneous and there is no single outcome measure that captures all the relevant information about a given individual. We propose that future studies need to capture (rather than ignore) the different physiologically-important dimensions of physical activity via generation of integrated, multidimensional physical activity 'profiles'. © 2013 Thompson, Batterham."

The main hypotheses are that (i) the existing vegetation-based ecological region could adequately elucidate the physiologic climate of the country, and (ii) physiologic stress has significantly increased over the years (1951-2009). Trends and changes in the selected indices (ET, THI and RSI) were examined over two time slices: 1951-1980 and 1981-2009. The results show that (1) the montane region was the most comfortable physiologic climate in Nigeria, and the regions around the Rivers Niger and Benue troughs were the most uncomfortable in most parts of the year, (2) physiologic stress in most parts of Nigeria has significantly increased in 1981-2009 over 1951-1980 (p ≤ 0. 05), (3) coping strategies to the uncomfortably hot and cold climate in Nigeria are limited to dressing mode, clothing materials and use of air conditioners or fan, (4) ET, THI and RSI results could be similar, and complementary; but each is with its strengths and weaknesses for annual or seasonal representations, which the others complemented for the interpretation of the physiologic climate of Nigeria. The study concluded that the relationship between the ecological classification of Nigeria and physiologic climate is rather complex, and the former could not elucidate the latter.

The threefold purpose of this paper is: to analyse the individual weights of the MBNQA criteria for organisations of the construction and the manufacturing industry within the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries in order to create a basis for self-assessment and benchmarking; to identify differences of criteria importance between the construction and the manufacturing industry (external alignment) in order to identify challenging areas on TQM when two organisations from the respective industries collaborate; and to compare the perspectives of project managers with those of quality management representatives (internal alignment) in order to identify challenging areas on an organisation's TQM caused by not aligned or contradicting perspectives. Design/methodology/approach - Questionnaire based in-depth interviews of GCC project managers and quality management representatives were analysed using a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to calculate the weights and subsequent ranking of seven quality criteria. Findings - When compared to the original weights of the MBNQA criteria, the 'results' criterion was found to be ranked the same. However, clear differences were identified regarding the criteria 'leadership' and 'measurement/analysis'. The differences between the two analysed industries were not significant, whereas project managers and quality management representatives have clearly differing views on all seven criteria. Originality/value - First, the analysed ranking of MBNQA quality criteria in the GCC countries gives organisations of the construction and the manufacturing industry a benchmark for comparison with their ranking of the MBNQA criteria. Second, clients may assume a common and hence strong basis for TQM when organisations belonging to the construction industry collaborate with organisations belonging to the manufacturing industry. Third, the organisations' internal communication between project managers and quality management representatives needs to be improved in order to pursue common TQM goals effectively. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However, sentinel soil-dwelling invertebrates can be used for such an assessment. This study aims to establish the modulating soil parameter of metal bioavailability to snails and a procedure for ranking field sites (n = 9; 43 plots) based on the evaluation of the transfer of metals to the land snails used as indicators of metal zooavailability. Multivariate regressions identify soil pH, organic carbon and iron oxides influence cadmium, chromium, copper, lead and zinc zooavailability to snails underlining the need to consider other parameter than total soil concentration during bioavailability assessment. However, for As, no influence of soil parameter on it bioavailability to snails was identified. Internal Concentrations of Reference (CIRef) of Cd, Pb, As, Cr, Cu and Zn were determined in Cantareus aspersus that were caged on unpolluted plots. CIRef allow for the identification of contaminated sites. CIRef have revealed unexpected metal transfer on some ""unpolluted"" sites and a lack of transfer on some contaminated sites, thus confirming the necessity for biological measures to evaluate metal mobility. The Sum of Excess of Transfers (SET) index ranked the industrially impacted sites as the top priorities for management. We recommend that the SET methodology be used for future environmental risk assessment. By highlighting real metal transfers and considering the numerous parameters influencing environmental bioavailability, the snails watch provides information on environmental quality. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-1542608339.xml,"Lithologically, the rock types in the Gabal El Fereyid area are dominantly granites with minor amounts of pegmatites. The granites range in composition from tonalite to granite-adamallite with minor acidic dikes, quartz and pegmatite veins. The granite-adamallite is peraluminous and formed as a result of partial melting of amphibole-bearing rocks at depths of ∼24-30km and at temperatures of 800-950°C. Among the different rock types, the muscovite-rich pegmatites had the highest U and Th contents (66 and 38ppm on average, respectively). The high level of radioactivity in pegmatites is attributed to the presence of the radioactive minerals thorianite, uranophane and allanite as confirmed by XRD analysis. Binary relations of Zr/U, Zr/Th, Ce/ U and Ce/Th against either U or Th in the granite-adamellite exhibit significant negative correlations indicating that both elements are not preferentially hosted in the accessory minerals phases such as zircon and monazite, but could be associated with major forming minerals such as biotite, muscovite, plagioclase and quartz, or U is situated within labile sites within granite. The uranium and thorium enrichment in the pegmatites is a two-stage process. The primary stage is magmatic whereas the secondary enrichment is from hydrothermal concentration. The magmatic U and Th are indicated by the presence of thorianite and allanite, whereas evidence of hydrothermal mineralization is the alteration of rock-forming minerals such as feldspar and the formation of secondary minerals such as uranophane and pyrite. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84874025140.xml,"Remote homology detection among proteins utilizing only the unlabelled sequences is a central problem in comparative genomics. The existing cluster kernel methods based on neighborhoods and profiles and the Markov clustering algorithms are currently the most popular methods for protein family recognition. The deviation from random walks with inflation or dependency on hard threshold in similarity measure in those methods requires an enhancement for homology detection among multi-domain proteins. We propose to combine spectral clustering with neighborhood kernels in Markov similarity for enhancing sensitivity in detecting homology independent of ""recent"" paralogs. The spectral clustering approach with new combined local alignment kernels more effectively exploits the unsupervised protein sequences globally reducing inter-cluster walks. When combined with the corrections based on modified symmetry based proximity norm deemphasizing outliers, the technique proposed in this article outperforms other state-of-the-art cluster kernels among all twelve implemented kernels. The comparison with the state-of-the-art string and mismatch kernels also show the superior performance scores provided by the proposed kernels. Similar performance improvement also is found over an existing large dataset. Therefore the proposed spectral clustering framework over combined local alignment kernels with modified symmetry based correction achieves superior performance for unsupervised remote homolog detection even in multi-domain and promiscuous domain proteins from Genolevures database families with better biological relevance.

2-s2.0-1542306709.xml,"EUROCARE-3 analysed the survival of 1 815584 adult cancer patients diagnosed from 1990 to 1994 in 22 European countries. The results are reported in tables, one per cancer site, coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 classification. The main findings of the tables are summarised and commented on in this article. For most solid cancers, wide differences in survival between different European populations were found, as also reported by EUROCARE-1 and EUROCARE-2, despite a remarkable (10%) overall increase in cancer survival from 1985 to 1994. Survival was highest in northern Europe (Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland), and fairly good in central-southern Europe (France, Switzerland, Austria and Spain). Survival was particularly low in eastern Europe, low in Denmark and the UK, and fairly low in Portugal and Malta. The mix of tumour stage at diagnosis explains much of the survival differences for cancers of the digestive tract, female reproductive system, breast, thyroid, and also skin melanoma. For tumours of the urinary tract and prostate, the differences were explained mainly by differences in diagnostic criteria and procedures. The case mix by anatomic subsite largely explains differences in survival for head and neck cancers. For oesophagus, pancreas, liver and brain cancer, with poor prognoses, survival differences were limited. Tumours, for which highly effective treatments are available, such as testicular cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma and some haematological malignancies, had fairly uniform survival across Europe. Survival for all tumours combined (an indicator of the overall cancer care performance of a nation's health system) was better in young than old patients, and better in women than men. The affluence of countries influenced overall cancer survival through the availability of adequate diagnostic and treatment procedures, and screening programmes. © 2003 European Society for Medical Oncology."
2-s2.0-1542361341.xml,"This paper reports an optically aligned hot-embossing and imprinting method for biomedical, microfluidic, and microoptical sensors. Hot-embossing technology is a low cost, flexible fabrication method, which has demonstrated high aspect ratio polymer microstructures as well as nanoimprinting patterns. It uses polymer substrates to imprint a pattern created on a master stamp. This allows the stamp to produce many fully patterned substrates for a wide range of materials and short production cycle times, and is therefore suited for applications from rapid prototyping to high volume production. The typical misalignment for mechanical alignment in hot-embossing is in the range of ±50 μm. By contrast, optical alignment accuracy can be achieved within ± 1 μm. This paper will show the principal equipment designs for optical alignment and hot-embossing process on silicon and quartz substrates. Alignment was performed on modified EVG620. In experiment, a. silicon wafers were aligned to silicon stamp using a process mode using digitally generated crosshairs, and b. quartz wafers were aligned to silicon stamp using a transparent alignment mode The EVG620 has been modified so that a vacuum line can be attached to a fitting on the bond tool. During alignment vacuum is applied through this line to hold the stamp to the bond tool. After alignment, the bond tool was transferred to semi automated commercially available EVG520 hot-embossing equipment to emboss the substrates."

2-s2.0-84874029247.xml,"Purpose: The cytidine analogs 5-azacytidine and decitabine, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), produce a molecular epigenetic effect, depletion of DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). This action is S-phase dependent. Hence, genetic factors that decrease the half-lives of these drugs could impact efficacy. Documentation of such impact, and elucidation of underlying mechanisms, could lead to improved clinical application. Experimental design: Cytidine deaminase (CDA) rapidly inactivates 5-azacytidine/decitabine. The effect of CDA SNP A79C and gender on CDA expression, enzyme activity, and drug pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics was examined in mice and humans, and the impact on overall survival (OS) was evaluated in 5-azacytidine/decitabine- treated patients with MDS (n = 90) and cytarabine-treated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 76). Results: By high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), plasma CDA activity was decreased as expected in individuals with the SNP A79C. Interestingly and significantly, there was an even larger decrease in females than in males. Explaining this decrease, liver CDA expression was significantly lower in female versus male mice. As expected, decitabine plasma levels, measured by mass spectrometry, were significantly higher in females. In mathematical modeling, the detrimental impact of shorter drug half-life (e.g., in males) was greater in low compared with high S-phase fraction disease (e.g., MDSvs. AML), because in high S-phase fraction disease, even a short exposure treats a major portion of cells. Accordingly, in multivariate analysis, OS was significantly worse in male versus female patients with MDS treated with 5-azacytidine/decitabine. Conclusions: Increased CDA expression/activity in males contributes to decreased cytidine analog half-life and likely contributes to worse outcomes with 5-azacytidine or decitabine therapy.

Here we compare the overall detection performance, correlations between extracted properties, and usability for feature tracking of four solar feature-detection algorithms: the Solar Monitor Active Region Tracker (SMART) detects active regions in line-of-sight magnetograms; the Automated Solar Activity Prediction code (ASAP) detects sunspots and pores in white-light continuum images; the Sunspot Tracking And Recognition Algorithm (STARA) detects sunspots in white-light continuum images; the Spatial Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm (SPoCA) automatically segments solar EUV images into active regions (AR), coronal holes (CH), and quiet Sun (QS). One month of data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and SOHO/Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) instruments during 12 May - 23 June 2003 is analysed. The overall detection performance of each algorithm is benchmarked against National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Solar Influences Data Analysis Center (SIDC) catalogues using various feature properties such as total sunspot area, which shows good agreement, and the number of features detected, which shows poor agreement. Principal Component Analysis indicates a clear distinction between photospheric properties, which are highly correlated to the first component and account for 52. 86% of variability in the data set, and coronal properties, which are moderately correlated to both the first and second principal components. Finally, case studies of NOAA 10377 and 10365 are conducted to determine algorithm stability for tracking the evolution of individual features. We find that magnetic flux and total sunspot area are the best indicators of active-region emergence. Additionally, for NOAA 10365, it is shown that the onset of flaring occurs during both periods of magnetic-flux emergence and complexity development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
2-s2.0-84873976668.xml,"Virtuousness in organizations involves individuals and teams being resilient, or bouncing back from setbacks in ways that allow them to adapt and grow. In two studies, we focus on emotional carrying capacity (ECC), wherein relationship partners express more of their emotions, express both positive and negative emotions, and do so constructively, as a source of resilience in individuals and in teams. Study 1's findings indicate that ECC is positively related to individual resilience and that ECC mediates the link between relationship closeness and individual resilience. Study 2's findings indicate a similar pattern for resilience at the team level: ECC is positively related to team resilience and mediates the connection between trust and team resilience. Together, these studies provide insight into how emotional expression in relationships is a key mechanism in explaining resilience, a foundational element for the pursuit of long-term virtuousness for individuals and for teams. © 2013 NTL Institute."
2-s2.0-84874001167.xml,"Flowering phenology of tree rhododendron (Rhododendron arboreum Sm.) was monitored in situ along elevation gradients in two distinct ecological settings. Observations were carried out in Gaoligong Nature Reserve (GNR) in China and in the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area (KCA) in Nepal. Using the crown density method, flowering events of the selected species were recorded. Flowering duration and synchrony were determined within each site and along the elevation gradient in each study area. Our observations showed high synchrony throughout the elevation gradient, especially for peak flowering. Mean 15-day soil temperature, soil parameters (soil moisture, nitrogen, organic matter and pH), age of the observed trees, and site characteristics (litter cover, canopy cover, inclination) were related to mean initial and peak flowering dates using partial least squares regression (PLS). Results differed between the two sites, but winter temperature was the most important variable affecting the regression model for both initial flowering and peak flowering at both sites. After temperature, soil moisture was the most important variable for explaining initial flowering dates. The distribution of tree rhododendron indicates that it is able to grow in a wide range of habitats with different environmental conditions. The recent trend of rising winter-spring temperature and the detected bloom-advancing effect of high temperatures during this period suggest that tree rhododendron might expand its distributional range in response to global warming. © 2012 ISB."
