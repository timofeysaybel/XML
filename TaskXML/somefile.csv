2-s2.0-84873919500.xml,"An increasing number of high-performance networks provision dedicated channels through circuit switching or MPLS/GMPLS techniques to support large data transfer. The link bandwidths in such networks are typically shared by multiple users through advance reservation, resulting in varying bandwidth availability in future time. Developing efficient scheduling algorithms for advance bandwidth reservation has become a critical task to improve the utilization of network resources and meet the transport requirements of application users. We consider an exhaustive combination of different path and bandwidth constraints and formulate four types of advance bandwidth scheduling problems, with the same objective to minimize the data transfer end time for a given transfer request with a prespecified data size: 1) fixed path with fixed bandwidth (FPFB); 2) fixed path with variable bandwidth (FPVB); 3) variable path with fixed bandwidth (VPFB); and 4) variable path with variable bandwidth (VPVB). For VPFB and VPVB, we further consider two subcases where the path switching delay is negligible or nonnegligible. We propose an optimal algorithm for each of these scheduling problems except for FPVB and VPVB with nonnegligible path switching delay, which are proven to be NP-complete and nonapproximable, and then tackled by heuristics. The performance superiority of these heuristics is verified by extensive experimental results in a large set of simulated networks in comparison to optimal and greedy strategies. © 1993-2012 IEEE."

2-s2.0-1542752744.xml,"The gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) has been documented visiting and breaking the eggs of artificial nests, but the implications of such observations are unclear because there is little cost in depredating an undefended nest. During the summer of 2001 at Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas, we videotaped a gray catbird that broke and consumed at least 1 egg in a brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum) nest. Our observation was consistent with egg predation because the catbird consumed the contents of the damaged egg after breaking it. The large difference in body mass suggests that a catbird (37 g) destroying eggs in a thrasher (69 g) nest might risk injury if caught in the act of predation and might explain why egg prédation by catbirds has been poorly documented. Our observation indicated that the catbird should be considered as an egg predator of natural nests and that single-egg predation of songbird nests should not be attributed to egg removal by female brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) without additional evidence."

Recently, we reported such a general assay, chemical complementation, which links enzyme catalysis to reporter gene transcription in vivo using the yeast three-hybrid assay. In this proof-of-principle experiment, it was shown that a wild-type β-lactamase enzyme could be isolated from a pool of inactive mutants using a lacZ screen. Ideally, however, such an assay should be able to distinguish enzymes based on their catalytic activity. Thus, here, we set out to determine if the catalytic efficiency of an enzyme variant does in fact correlate with its level of transcription activation in the chemical complementation assay. First, the reaction mechanism for the cleavage of the β-lactam substrate used in the chemical complementation proof-of-principle experiment was determined.

The forward modeling is based on a domain integral equation approach formulated in terms of the electric and magnetic contrast sources normalized with the characteristic impedance of the background medium. Our numerical tests indicate that this formulation is prerequisite in order to arrive at a forward solution within an acceptable number of iterations, and hence it is also of significant importance in the optimization process of the inverse problem. The inverse scattering problem is attacked using the Multiplicative Regularized Contrast Source Inversion method as known in the literature.

Aims: To clarify and contrast risk factors for such deaths among cancer patients. Methods: A SEER (1973-2007) analysis was conducted on 4,449,957 cancer patients comparing all causes of death (COD) to accidental and suicidal deaths through competing hazards, relative risk andproportional hazards models. SEER did not provide psychological assessments; the analysiswas confined to their standard epidemiological and clinicopathological parameters. Results: 2,557,385 overall deaths yielded 16,879 (0.66%) accidents and 6,589 (0.26%) suicides. Mortality reached its highest incidence immediately after diagnosis and obeyed Pareto type II distributions. The major identifiable risk factor for suicide was male gender; for accidental death, First Nations ethnicity; and all COD, metastases. Minor factors for suicide included metastases, advanced age, and respiratory as well as head and neck tumors, whereas for accidental death they were male gender, metastases, advanced age, and brain tumors. Conclusions: Differences were observed in the risk patterns of suicide and accidental death, suggesting distinct etiologies. A high incidence of suicides and accidental deaths following diagnosis (attributed by some to stress from the diagnosis of cancer) correlated here with overall mortality and indicators of physical morbidity. Cancer patients with the above identifiable risk factors warrant supportive attention. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing."

We propose the treatment of chronic slow-transit constipation with subtotal colectomy and antiperistaltic caecoproctostomy. The sparing of the caecum, the ileo-caecal valve and the distal ileal loop, leaving a physiologic reservoir, allowing the presence of colic bacterial flora which metabolises the undigested starch and produces short chain fatty acids, should guarantee a normal stool consistency, normal absorption of water, sodium and vitamin B12 and the prevention of renal and gallbladder lithiasis. In 1992, we started a study on the outcome of 19 patients who had undergone subtotal colectomy and antiperistaltic caeco-rectal anastomosis for slow-transit constipation. The surgical procedure was carried out without any serious complications and without mortality. The mean clinical follow-up was 64 months (range 5-132). Six months after surgery, 13 patients reported normal bowel movements with solid stool consistency, 5 reported diarrhoea and the need for antidiarrhoeal agents, and one reported constipation easily controlled with laxatives. Fifteen patients considered their quality of life as having improved compared with that before surgery. Selection of patients justify such very satisfying results. It is well known that colic resection is effective only in the case of slow transit constipation, and thus a careful physiologic assessment is needed to rule out other causes of constipation, such as outlet obstruction syndrome."

Subjects listened to sentences like Jane told her brother that he was exceptionally quick/slow, designed such that the alternative critical words were equally acceptable within the local sentence context. In Experiment 1, these sentences were embedded in a discourse that rendered one of the critical words anomalous (e.g. because Jane's brother had in fact done something very quickly). Relative to the coherent alternative, these discourse-anomalous words elicited a standard N400 effect that started at 150-200 ms after acoustic word onset. Furthermore, when the same sentences were heard in isolation in Experiment 2, the N400 effect disappeared. The results demonstrate that our listeners related the unfolding spoken words to the wider discourse extremely rapidly, after having heard the first two or three phonemes only, and in many cases well before the end of the word. In addition, the identical nature of discourse- and sentence-dependent N400 effects suggests that from the perspective of the word-elicited comprehension process indexed by the N400, the interpretive context delineated by a single unfolding sentence and a larger discourse is functionally identical. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we compare antibody responses of subjects living in an area where lymphatic filariasis is endemic with antibody responses elicited in a murine model of filarial infection, to provide evidence that the infective larval stage (L3), not adult nematodes, are the primary inducer of responses against Wolbachia. In human subjects, antibody responses to Brugia malayi Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) are most often correlated with antibody responses to the L3 stage of B. malayi. Analysis of anti-WSP responses induced in mice by different stages of the rodent filariae Litomosoides sigmodontis shows that the strongest anti-WSP response is elicited by the L3 stage. Although adult filarial nematode death may play a role in the generation of an anti-WSP response, it is the L3 stage that is the major source of immunogenic material, and incoming L3 provide a continual boosting of the anti-WSP response. Significant exposure to the endosymbiotic bacteria may occur earlier in nematode infection than previously thought, and the level of exposure to infective insect bites may be a key determinant of disease progression."

2-s2.0-84873930629.xml,"Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in man, are complex diseases in which genetic and environmental factors interact to promote an excessive mucosal immune response directed against normal components of the bacterial microflora. There is also evidence that the pathologic process is due to defects in counterregulatory mechanisms, such as those involving the immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Indeed, studies in human IBD tissues and murine models of colitis have documented a disruption of TGF-β1 signalling marked by a block in the phosphorylation of Smad3, a signalling molecule associated with the activated TGF-β receptor, due to up-regulation of Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of Smad3 phosphorylation. Knock-down of Smad7 with a specific antisense oligonucleotide restores TGF-β1/Smad3 signalling, thus resulting in a marked suppression of inflammatory cytokine production and attenuation of murine colitis. These findings together with the demonstration that Smad7 antisense oligonucleotide is not toxic when administered in mice have paved the way for the development of a Smad7 antisense oligonucleotidebased pharmaceutical compound that is now ready to enter the clinics. In this article we review the available data supporting the pathogenic role of Smad7 in IBD and discuss whether and how Smad7 antisense therapy could help dampen the ongoing inflammation in IBD. © 2012 Baishideng.

Small-reflection approximations are discussed. Two applications are proposed: anti-reflection coatings and high-reflection coatings. For the first application, a structure consisting of two slabs of the same width and opposite permittivities is studied. If the structure is placed between two semi-infinite media of the same kind, the reflection vanish, while if these two media are different, the reflection depends only on their characteristics and on the angle of incidence. This device could be advantageously used as an antenna radome. For the second application, a structure consisting of a large number of identical pairs of slabs of high and low opposite permittivities and of the same widths, embedded in the same medium, is studied.

2-s2.0-1642291070.xml,"Simulations in the authors' previous studies have shown that a modified temperature integration regime with a 6-day averaging period and increased set-point flexibility was able to reduce annual energy consumption by up to 9% as compared to a regular temperature integration regime. The commonly applied fixed set-point for relative humidity (RH) of 80-85% strongly reduced the potential for energy saving with this regime. Therefore, a more flexible humidity control regime was developed. Simulations indicated that yearly energy consumption could be reduced by 18% as compared to a fixed set-point of 80% RH. By combining the two regimes (temperature integration and humidity control), it was predicted that the energy saving would be even greater. To test this prediction, the combined regimes were applied in two experiments with cut-flower chrysanthemum crops investigating the effect on plant development and growth. Different temperature bandwidths for temperature integration (±2, ±4, ±6 and ±8°C) were also compared within the joint regime. Crop development was only delayed with the ±8°C temperature bandwidth. The best regime with respect to plant development, growth, quality and energy saving (±6°C temperature bandwidth) was compared in a spring experiment with a climate regime used in commercial practice. Energy consumption was 23.5% less with the joint regime. No negative consequences of high humidity were observed, but there was a strong increase in the dry weight of all plant organs. Total plant dry weight was 39% higher than in the regular regime. It can be concluded that energy saving and crop yield increase can be achieved simultaneously, although the dynamic temperature control has to be adjusted to the chrysanthemum developmental stage. The combined dynamic climate regime forms a promising basis for future climate controllers and is easily extendable to other greenhouse crops. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The pathogen fate model uses the transport fields generated by the hydrodynamic model to predict the distributions of specific pathogens associated with fecal contamination. The modeling framework, used to determine the abundance of enteric organisms in Quincy Bay, includes pathogen loads from the outfalls and shoreline sources, dispersion and loss processes that include phototoxicity, temperature, salinity, predation or die-off and settling. The ability of the model to simulate advective and dispersive processes in Quincy Bay was assessed by comparing model results against observed temperature, salinity and fecal coliform.

2-s2.0-1542705312.xml,"An electronically controllable, switched parasitic planar array can be used for the purpose of direction finding. The method proposed in this paper exploits the electronic beam steering, achieved by simply inserting an appropriate digital word in the antenna feeding circuit, to resolve two signals. A genetic algorithm was used to determine the strengths and the angular positions of the incoming signals in the azimuth plane. The results obtained concentrate on wideband signaling in a multipath environment, with and without the presence of noise. The antenna design and the reliability of the direction-finding method are presented. The proposed method is strongly dependent on the type of the receiving antenna (a switched parasitic planar array is superior to a ""uniform"" antenna with identical radiation patterns). Increasing the number of radiation patterns available improves the reliability of the method. The reliability of the method slightly deteriorates, as the angular discrimination of the incoming signals becomes smaller, but the results remain quite satisfying."
2-s2.0-1442360988.xml,"We present a robust iterative method to solve the inverse scattering problem in cases where the Born approximation is valid. We formulate this linearized inverse problem in terms of the unknown material contrast and the unknown contrast sources and we solve the problem by minimizing a cost functional consisting of two terms. The first term represents the differences between the actual data and the modeled data, while the second term represents the misfit in the constitutive relations between the contrast sources and the incident fields. In each iteration, the contrast sources and the contrast are reconstructed alternatingly, using subsequently a conjugate gradient step for the contrast source updates and a direct inversion of a diagonal matrix for the contrast. A further regularization with a multiplicative regularization factor is discussed. In this regularization procedure the relative variation of the contrast is minimized as well. As a test case we consider the two-dimensional (2-D) transverse magnetic polarization problem. Synthetic numerical examples are presented in order to compare the presented algorithm to the traditional Born algorithm. Results with respect to the inversion of experimental data are presented as well. In addition, some inversion results for the subsurface sensing problem, both in two and three dimensions, are presented."
2-s2.0-84873908474.xml,"AIM: To investigate the protective effect and mechanisms of ghrelin postconditioning against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced injury in human gastric epithelial cells. METHODS: The model of H/R injury was established in gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1) human gastric epithelial cells. Cells were divided into seven groups: normal control group (N); H/R postconditioning group; DMSO postconditioning group (DM); ghrelin postconditioning group (GH); D-Lys3-GHRP-6 + ghrelin postconditioning group (D + GH); capsazepine + ghrelin postconditioning group (C + GH); and LY294002 + ghrelin postconditioning group (L + GH). 3-(4,5-dimethylthazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to detect GES-1 cell viability. Hoechst 33258 fluorochrome staining and flow cytometry were conducted to determine apoptosis of GES-1 cells. Spectrophotometry was performed to determine release of lactate dehydrogenate (LDH). Protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β was determined by western blotting. Expression of vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1), Akt and GSK-3β was observed by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the H/R group, cell viability of the GH group was significantly increased in a dosedependent manner (55.9% ± 10.0% vs 69.6% ± 9.6%, 71.9% ± 17.4%, and 76.3% ± 13.3%). Compared with the H/R group, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the GH group significantly decreased (12.38% ± 1.51% vs 6.88% ± 0.87%). Compared with the GH group, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the D + GH group, C + GH group and L + GH groups significantly increased (11.70% ± 0.88%, 11.93% ± 0.96%, 10.20% ± 1.05% vs 6.88% ± 0.87%). There were no significant differences in the percentage of apoptotic cells between the H/R and DM groups (12.38% ± 1.51% vs 13.00% ± 1.13%). There was a significant decrease in LDH release following ghrelin postconditioning compared with the H/R group (561.58 ± 64.01 U/L vs 1062.45 ± 105.29 U/L). There was a significant increase in LDH release in the D + GH, C + GH and L + GH groups compared with the GH group (816.89 ± 94.87 U/L, 870.95 ± 64.06 U/L, 838.62 ± 118.45 U/L vs 561.58 ± 64.01 U/L). There were no significant differences in LDH release between the H/R and DM groups (1062.45 ± 105.29 U/L vs 1017.65 ± 68.90 U/L). Compared with the H/R group, expression of Bcl-2 and Akt increased in the GH group, whereas expression of Bax and GSK- 3β decreased. Compared with the GH group, expression of Bcl-2 decreased and Bax increased in the D + GH, C + GH and L + GH groups, and Akt decreased and GSK-3β increased in the L + GH group. The H/R group also upregulated expression of VR1 and GSK-3β and downregulated Akt. The number of VR1-positive and Akt-positive cells in the GH group significantly increased, whereas the number of GSK-3β-positive cells significantly decreased. These effects of ghrelin were reversed by capsazepine and LY294002. CONCLUSION: Ghrelin postconditioning protected against H/R-induced injury in human gastric epithelial cells, which indicated that this protection might be associated with GHS-R, VR1 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. © 2012 Baishideng.

Knowledge of the plaque composition, vulnerability and its elastic properties can assist the clinician in selecting appropriate interventional techniques. However, several noise sources have to be addressed to obtain quality intravascular elastograms. Misalignment of the vessel lumen and the ultrasound beam can produce erroneous strain estimates in elastography. Errors in the strain estimate are introduced due to the eccentricity and tilt of the intravascular transducer within the vessel lumen. Previous work in this area has provided theoretical expressions for the correction of eccentricity and tilt errors when they occur independent of each other. However, under most imaging conditions, both eccentricity and tilt errors are simultaneously present. In this paper, we extend the theoretical correction factor by accounting for the influence of both of these errors occurring simultaneously in the positioning of the catheter within the vessel lumen."
2-s2.0-1642351380.xml,"Purpose: In order to establish a more faithful model of clinically recurrent ovarian cancer after paclitaxel-based chemotherapy, a paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line was established in vivo, and its biological profiles were compared with the conventional in vitro established drug-resistant cell line. Methods: An in vivo paclitaxel-resistant subline (OM1/ Tvivo) was established from the parental human ovarian cancer cell line (OVMG1) by repeated paclitaxel administration into tumor-bearing mice. As a control, the in vivo drug-sensitive subline (OM1/Cvivo) was made in the same manner, without paclitaxel. An in vitro paclitaxel-resistant subline (OM1/Tvitro) was established by exposure to stepwise increased concentrations of the drug in a cell culture medium. Chromosomal analysis, evaluation of growth, invasiveness and metastasis, in vivo and in vitro drug sensitivity, and a pharmacokinetic study were performed. Results: Both in vivo sublines confirmed their human origin by G-band chromosomal analysis and showed a similar cell growth rate in cell culture. As for in vivo tumor growth, OM1/ Tvivo showed enhanced tumor growth property compared with OM1/Cvivo, while OM1/Tvitro lost tumorigenicity. Both OM1/Tvivo and OM1/Cvivo sublines as well as their parental OVMG1 could not form either invasive or metastatic lesions. Compared with the OM1/ Cvivo subline, the OM1/Tvivo tumor showed stable drug-resistance and lower drug distribution after paclitaxel administration into mice, whereas cultured OM1/ Tvivo cells lost both completely. On the other hand, an unreasonably higher level of drug-resistance and lower drug concentration was detected in vitro only in OM1/ Tvitro cells after exposure to the drug in a culture medium. Conclusions: These results suggest that the in vivo established paclitaxel-resistant cell line, rather than the conventional in vitro established cell line, is a suitable and faithful model for clinically recurrent tumors showing transformed aggressiveness. The in vivo specific drug-resistant mechanism should involve an interaction between the tumor and host stromal tissue rather than only changes in cellular drug sensitivity. The present study is probably the first report of an in vivo established paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line, and the elucidation of such an in vivo drug-resistance mechanism may be clinically important in preventing or overcoming acquired drug-resistant ovarian cancers recurring after paclitaxel-based chemotherapy."

In the quantitative analysis, the tumor-muscle SIR and the liver- muscle SIR observed with Gd-EOB-enhanced MRI were 0.80 ± 0.24 and 1.28 ± 0.33 precontrast, 1.92 ± 0.58 and 1.57 ± 0.55 during the arterial phase, 1.87 ± 0.44 and 1.73 ± 0.39 during the portal venous phase, 1.63 ± 0.41 and 1.78 ± 0.39 during the equilibrium phase, and 1.10 ± 0.43 and 1.92 ± 0.50 during the hepatobiliary phase, respectively. The attenuation values in the tumor and liver parenchyma observed with enhanced CT were 40.60 ± 8.78 and 53.78 ± 7.37 precontrast, 172.66 ± 73.89 and 92.76 ± 17.92 during the arterial phase, 152.76 ± 35.73 and 120.12 ± 18.02 during the portal venous phase, and 108.74 ± 18.70 and 89.04 ± 7.25 during the equilibrium phase, respectively. Hemangiomas demonstrated peak enhancement during the arterial phase, and both the SIR with Gd-EOB-DDTPA-enhanced MRI and the attenuation value with enhanced CT decreased with time. The SIR of hemangiomas was lower than that of liver parenchyma during the equilibrium and hepatobiliary phases on Gd-EOB-enhanced MRI. However, the attenuation of hemangiomas after contrast injection was higher than that of liver parenchyma during all phases of enhanced CT. CONCLUSION: Prolonged enhancement during the equilibrium phase was observed less frequently on Gd-EOB-DDTPA-enhanced MRI than enhanced CT, which may exacerbate differentiating between hemangiomas and malignant tumors. © 2012 Baishideng.

A temperature of 45°C and 30 min of extraction was established as optimal conditions for preparing gelatin from cod skins. Fish gelatin in 5% solutions formed gels at room temperature in the presence of transglutaminase (0.15-0.7 mg of enzyme protein/ml), depending on the reaction time. Transglutaminase was also active in crosslinking of fish gelatin at 4-5°C. The deformation of gels obtained from 5% gelatin solutions after a 24-h incubation with transglutaminase, at concentration 0.25 mg/ml, measured at 6-8°C, was the same as or slightly lower than in control samples (without enzyme).

The mass of polymer immobilized onto the silica surface was controlled by the amount of coupling agent, 1,6-hexamethylenediisocyanate, added during the coating process. The influence of the polymer coating on the physical features of the beads was investigated by means of nitrogen adsorption/desorption methods, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersion X-ray analysis. The column lifetime was found to be primarily dependent on the extent of crosslinking of the stationary phase. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the synthesis of highly crosslinked stationary phases with a reasonable column lifetime gave rise to a phase separation of the β-cyclodextrin polymer.

For the search, the keywords used were: intussusception, IFP, intussusception and IFP, intussusception due to IFP, and IFP presenting as intussusception. The search covered all articles from 1976 to November 2011. RESULTS: We present a 38-year-old woman who was admitted 10 d after experiencing abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea. Ultrasonography demonstrated small bowel intussusception. An ileal intussusception due to a mass lesion 50 cm proximal to the ileocecal junction was found during laparotomy. Partial ileal resection and anastomosis were performed. A diagnosis of ileal IFP was made based on the immunohistochemical findings. In addition, a total of 56 reports concerning 85 cases of intussusception due to IFP meeting the aforementioned criteria was included in the literature review. The patients were aged 4 to 81 years (mean, 49 ± 16.2 years); 44 were women (mean, 51.8 ± 14.3 years) and 41 were men (mean, 46 ± 17.5 years). According to the location of the IFP, ileal intussusception was found in 63 patients, while 17 had jejunal, three had colonic, and two had ileojejunal intussusception.

2-s2.0-1442284666.xml,"There is a growing awareness, both in industry and academia, of the crucial role of formally verifying the translation from high-level source-code into low-level object code that is typically performed by an optimizing compiler. Formally verifying an optimizing compiler, as one would verify any other large program, is not feasible due to its size, ongoing evolution and modification, and, possibly, proprietary considerations. Translation validation is a novel approach that offers an alternative to the verification of translators in general and compilers in particular: Rather than verifying the compiler itself, one constructs a validation tool which, after every run of the compiler, formally confirms that the target code produced in the run is a correct translation of the source program. The paper presents VOC, a methodology for the translation validation of optimizing compilers. We distinguish between structure, preserving optimizations, for which we establish a simulation relation between the source and target code based on computational induction, and structure modifying optimizations, for which we develop specialized ""permutation rules.

2-s2.0-84873925093.xml,"Cytokines are indispensable signals of the mucosaassociated immune system for maintaining normal gut homeostasis. An imbalance of their profile in favour of inflammation initiation may lead to disease states, such as that is observed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although Crohn's disease (CD) is often described as a prototype of T-helper 1-type diseases, and ulcerative colitis (UC) is traditionally viewed as a T-helper 2-mediated condition, the classic paradigm, which categorises cytokines into pro- and anti-inflammatory groups, has recently been changed. The inflammation regulatory pathways may not be mutually exclusive as individual cytokines can have diverse and even opposing functions in various clinical and immunological settings. None the less there are many common immunological responses in IBD that are mediated by cytokines. Although they regulate and influence the development, course and recurrence of the inflammatory process, the concrete pathogenic role of these small signaling molecules is sometimes not unambiguous in the subtypes of the disease. Our aim is to review the current information about pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of traditionally studied and recently discovered cytokines in the pathogenesis of UC and CD.

2-s2.0-1542606327.xml,"The PEA3/E1AF/ETV4 gene encodes an Ets-related transcription factor that is expressed in the epithelial cells of the mammary gland. Previous reports have shown that PEA3 can up-regulate promoter activities of many genes associated with tumorigenesis. A significant fraction of those encode matrix metalloproteinases (MMP genes) required for degradation of the extracellular matrix. To better obtain a molecular characterization of PEA3 expression in sporadic breast cancer, we quantified PEA3 mRNA by means of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay in a large series of human primary breast tumors. PEA3 expression showed wide variations in tumor tissues, being under-expressed in 30 of 130 (23.1%) and over-expressed in 18 of 130 (13.8%) compared with normal breast tissues. High PEA3 mRNA levels correlated significantly with Scarff-Bloom-Richardson histopathological grade III (P = 0.018) but not with poor prognosis, suggesting that PEA3 is a marker of tumor aggressiveness rather than a prognostic factor in human breast cancer. We also observed positive links between the expression of PEA3 and those of MKI67 and ERBB2 (P = 0.034 and P = 0.045, respectively) and an inverse relationship with ERα (P = 0.0016). Our results do not support recent findings suggesting that PEA3 could be a tumor-suppressor gene that can act therapeutically in ERBB2 over-expressed tumors. Our results also suggest major roles of the MMP2, NRG1 and CGB genes (which encode type I gelatinase, heregulin and human chorionic gonadotropin β subunit, respectively) in the PEA3 pathway dysregulation observed in breast cancer. Taken together, the data confirm the role of the PEA3 gene in breast tumorigenesis, and suggest the existence of numerous other still unknown genes transactivated by the PEA3 transcription factor."

However, recently the genetic background is more frequently used for explanation of this phenomenon. One of the main causes of immunosenesence is involution of the thymus. The results of this process are changes in subpopulations and functioning of T cells, as well as mainly secondary dysfunction of other types of immune cells.

2-s2.0-1642506276.xml,"Retinal visual fields were determined in Southern Ground Hornbills Bucorvus leadbeateri and Southern Yellow-billed Hornbills Tockus leucomelas (Coraciiformes, Bucerotidae) using an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique. In both species the binocular field is relatively long and narrow with a maximum width of 30° occurring 40° above the bill. The bill tip projects into the lower half of the binocular field. This frontal visual field topography exhibits a number of key features that are also found in other terrestrial birds. This supports the hypothesis that avian visual fields are of three principal types that are correlated with the degree to which vision is employed when taking food items, rather than with phylogeny. However, unlike other species studied to date, in both hornbill species the bill intrudes into the binocular field. This intrusion of the bill restricts the width of the binocular field but allows the birds to view their own bill tips. It is suggested that this is associated with the precision-grasping feeding technique of hornbills. This involves forceps-like grasping and manipulation of items in the tips of the large decurved bill. The two hornbill species differ in the extent of the blind area perpendicularly above the head. Interspecific comparison shows that eye size and the width of the blind area above the head are significantly correlated. The limit of the upper visual field in hornbills is viewed through the long lash-like feathers of the upper lids and these appear to be used as a sunshade mechanism. In Ground Hornbills eye movements are non-conjugate and have sufficient amplitude (30-40°) to abolish the frontal binocular field and to produce markedly asymmetric visual field configurations."
2-s2.0-1642280184.xml,"Intentional influence on body weight changes is limited. In the past ten years it became more and more evident, that body weight depends on a homeostatic process. Weight changes cause counterregulating processes aimed at restoring the initial weight. By now there is an abundant amount of literature, which increasingly revealed parts of the weight regulating mechanism. New technologies like functional brain mapping contributed to the new concept of a ""weight regulating network"" within the hypothalamus. Leptin and ghrelin are circulating factors that inform the hypothalamic network on peripheral energy needs. Psychological theories of adjustment of hunger and satiety comply with the neuroendocrinologic evidence and complete our understanding of body weight control. The disinhibition/restriction hypothesis of Herman and Polivy describes disturbed eating behaviour which is relevant for bulimia nervosa and bulimic forms of anorexia nervosa but especially for weight reduction by caloric restriction in obesity. Consequentially, long-term weight loss in obese patients cannot be achieved by short-term changes of energy balance but only by long-term changes of life style. Hunger, if present, not only before meal time will threaten the maintenance of weight reduction. Thus restriction of caloric intake is limited by the subjective energy needs rather than by total energy expenditure."

2-s2.0-1542681071.xml,"An electronically controllable, switched parasitic planar array can be used for the purpose of direction finding. The method proposed in this paper exploits the electronic beam steering, achieved by simply inserting an appropriate digital word in the antenna feeding circuit, to resolve two signals. A genetic algorithm was used to determine the strengths and the angular positions of the incoming signals in the azimuth plane. The results obtained concentrate on wideband signaling in a multipath environment, with and without the presence of noise. The antenna design and the reliability of the direction-finding method are presented. The proposed method is strongly dependent on the type of the receiving antenna (a switched parasitic planar array is superior to a ""uniform"" antenna with identical radiation patterns). Increasing the number of radiation patterns available improves the reliability of the method. The reliability of the method slightly deteriorates, as the angular discrimination of the incoming signals becomes smaller, but the results remain quite satisfying."

Geometry simplification methods may be used to reduce the polygon count and obtain a multiresolution representation. However, those methods fail to preserve the visual structure of a tree. We propose a different approach: procedural multiresolution. We build procedural models that reflect a tree's visual structure at different resolution levels. The models are based on parametric L-systems. Our method takes a parametric chain representing a tree and generates a new chain with embedded multiresolution information. The algorithm is based on a metric that quantifies the relevance of the branches of a tree. The representation supports efficient geometry extraction and produces good visual results."
2-s2.0-1542380291.xml,"OBJECTIVES: Careful assessment of tumor extension is required before partial laryngectomy in order to ensure optimal carcinological safety. Laryngoscopy and CT-scan constitute the explorations of reference. We investigated the value of these two examinations and their association for the evaluation of glottic and supraglottic tumors. METHOD: We compared laryngoscopy and CT findings with those of the pathologic examination of the surgical specimen in a retrospective study of 57 patients. RESULTS: The results were presented by T-staging, then as a function of the laryngeal floor of the tumor and the anatomic localization. The laryngoscopy findings were most contributive for small tumors. Large spaces are better examined with the scanner. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the performance of laryngoscopy and CT-scan for the assessment of glottic and supraglottic tumors can be improved by a better knowledge of the limitations of each type of explorations for this type of assessment. CT-scan currently provides a better topographic assessment of the tumor than endoscopy; even higher performance can be expected with the advent of technological advances."

When 3-day-old rats were injected intracisternally with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), a marked depletion of brain 5-HT was observed when animals were killed 3 months after the treatment. Brain catecholamine content was generally not changed by neurotoxin treatment. The behavioral consequence of intracisternal 5,7-DHT administration to developing rats consisted in reduction of adult rats' activity in the forced swimming test.

The creation process of the snapshot, as well as the result of the study, aims to help in diagnosing the current status of quality management (QM) and further contribute in understanding and shaping its future direction. For this purpose, all published articles during the last 25 years' period (1987-2011) under the subject of Total Quality Management (TQM), Business Excellence (BE), quality tools, techniques as well as core values/principles have been collected through the ABI/INFORM complete periodical database. The collected data were analysed and reflected in order to show the current status, evolution trends of the past, and the predicted future directions. The results show that the total number of articles under the subject of TQM has been decreasing after having reached its peak in 1995. However, papers focusing on techniques and tools within the QM framework in terms of Lean, Just-in-Time/Toyota Production System, Benchmarking, and Six-Sigma Quality have been increasing. In addition, papers focusing on core values/key principles needed to build a quality culture in terms of leadership, people-based management, continuous improvements, management based on facts, and focus on the customer have been slightly increasing during the last decade. The findings indicate that QM is now at a more mature stage where focuses have shifted from being initially on TQM to tools, techniques, and core values which are needed for building a quality and BE culture. Based on its evolution, it is concluded that TQM can be understood as a management innovation, if not a management revolution. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Thus a phenomenon of virtuous circle was identified: the global take-care of the animal (basic and peripheral services) seems linked to a sudden awareness of the importance of vaccination.

Both patients underwent intensive video-electroencephalography monitoring, with simultaneous neuropsychological tests. In both patients, reflex epileptic myoclonus was more easily triggered by writing that required a higher degree of concentration. Conversely, other cognitive tasks, such as reading, typing, thinking, or calculation never elicited any seizures or myoclonus. Valproate was effective in controlling both spontaneous and reflex epileptic seizures. The results of this study further support the notion that 'praxis-induced' reflex epilepsy precipitated by specific stimuli occurs in the context of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Our results also illustrate that writing tasks are more effective in eliciting seizures when they require higher levels of concentration and mental elaboration."

METHODS: Systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies through January 2011. Search terms were ""bisphosphonates"" or trade names of the drugs, and ""observational studies"" or ""cohort studies"" or ""case-control studies"". Two evaluators reviewed and selected articles on the basis of predetermined selection criteria as followed: (1) observational studies (case-control or cohort studies) on bisphosphonate use; (2) with at least 2 years of follow-up; and (3) reported data on the incidence of cancer diagnosis. The DerSimonian and Laird random effects model were used to calculate the pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Two-by-two contingency table was used to calculate the outcomes not suitable for meta-analysis. Subgroup meta-analyses were conducted for the type of cancer (esophageal, gastric and colorectal cancers). Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the effect sizes when only studies with long-term follow-up (mean 5 years; subgroup 3 years) were included. RESULTS: Of 740 screened articles, 3 cohort studies and 3 case-control studies were included in the analyses. At first, 4 cohort studies and 3 case-control studies were selected for the analyses but one cohort study was excluded because the cancer outcomes were not categorized by type of gastrointestinal cancer. More than 124 686 subjects participated in the 3 cohort studies. The mean follow-up time in all of the cohort studies combined was approximately 3.88 years. The 3 case-control studies reported 3070 esophageal cancer cases and 15 417 controls, 2018 gastric cancer cases and 10 007 controls, and 11 574 colorectal cancer cases and 53 955 controls. The percentage of study participants who used bisphosphonate was 2.8% among the cases and 2.9% among the controls.

The model was configured into a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and particle tracking model, ITM, which uses neutrally buoyant passive particles as surrogates for ichthyoplankton. In ITM, particles are transported by multidimensional advection and dispersion processes. The model was driven by time-dependent water levels, temperature and salinity along open boundaries, meteorological forcing and freshwater inflows. It was calibrated using observed surface and bottom salinity and temperature, water surface elevations and surface, mid-depth and bottom currents at locations across the New York harbor and the East River during 1994 and 1995. Results indicate that estuarine circulation greatly determined the distribution of particles in the East River. The probability that ichthyoplankton would be entrained into the Charles Poletti plant intake structure was highly dependent on the location and time of their release and the assumption that ichthyoplankton behave like neutrally buoyant particles."

Its derivation is governed by the flow physics, thus enabling interpolation between different profile geometries.

The Laguerre-Volterra network methodology for modeling nonlinear systems is employed to this purpose. Results are obtained in the form of Volterra kernels as well as in the form of the dynamic modes of the system. Three significant modes are identified, one of them residing mostly in the linear system dynamics, and the other two residing in the nonlinear system dynamics. The obtained results reveal that the latter are affected mainly in the low frequency range (below 0.04 Hz), whereas they remain unaffected in the intermediate frequency range (between 0.04 and 0.08 Hz) and are affected moderately above 0.08 Hz."

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 167 intestinal BD patients between March 1986 and April 2011. We also investigated the endoscopic parameters including ulcer locations, distribution, number, depth, shape, size and margin to identify independent factors associated with DAIBD. An endoscopic severity model was developed using significant colonoscopic variables identified by multivariate regression analysis and its correlation with the DAIBD was evaluated. To determine factors related to the discrepancy between endoscopic severity and clinical activity, clinical characteristics and laboratory markers of the patients were analyzed. RESULTS: A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the number of intestinal ulcers (≥ 2, P = 0.031) and volcanoshaped ulcers (P = 0.001) were predictive factors for the DAIBD. An endoscopic severity model (Y) was developed based on selected endoscopic variables as follows: Y = 47.44 + 9.04 × non-Ileocecal area + 11.85 × ≥ 2 of intestinal ulcers + 5.03 × shallow ulcers + 12.76 × deep ulcers + 4.47 × geographicshaped ulcers + 26.93 × volcano-shaped ulcers + 8.65 × ≥ 20 mm of intestinal ulcers. However, endoscopic parameters used in the multivariate analysis explained only 18.9% of the DAIBD variance. Patients with severe DAIBD scores but with moderately predicted disease activity by the endoscopic severity model had more symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (21.4% vs 4.9%, P = 0.026) and a lower rate of corticosteroid use (50.0% vs 75.6%, P = 0.016) than those with severe DAIBD scores and accurately predicted disease by the model. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the number of intestinal ulcers and volcano-shaped ulcers were predictive factors for severe DAIBD scores.

2-s2.0-1642317491.xml,"Objective: The cortisol increase after awakening has been shown to be associated with work-related stress. Several studies demonstrated a moderate stability of cortisol awakening responses on subsequent days, suggesting situation-dependent variance. This study tests whether cortisol awakening responses are different on weekdays compared with weekend days and whether such differences may be explained by chronic work overload and worrying. Methods: Two hundred nineteen participants took saliva samples immediately after awakening and 30, 45, and 60 minutes later on 6 consecutive days starting on Saturday. Perceived chronic work overload and worrying were assessed by a standardized questionnaire. Results: There is a clear weekend-weekday difference in the cortisol response to awakening. This difference is associated with chronic work overload and worry. Independent of sex and weekend-weekday differences in time of awakening and sleep duration, participants who report higher levels of chronic work overload and worrying show a stronger increase and higher mean levels of cortisol after awakening on weekdays, but not on weekend days. Conclusions: The weekend-weekday differences in the cortisol awakening response and their association with chronic stress clearly demonstrate that the day of cortisol assessment is crucial in psychoendocrinological stress studies."
2-s2.0-1642505414.xml,"A search for genes that promote or block CNS regeneration requires numerous approaches; for example, tests can be made on individual candidate molecules. Here, however, we describe methods for comprehensive identification of genes up- and down-regulated in neurons that can and cannot regenerate after injury. One problem concerns identification of low-abundance genes out of the 30 000 or so genes expressed by neurons. Another difficulty is knowing whether a single gene or multiple genes are necessary. When microchips and subtractive differential display are used to identify genes turned on or off, the numbers are still too great to test which molecules are actually important for regeneration. Candidates are genes coding for trophic, inhibitory, receptor and extracellular matrix molecules, as well as unknown genes. A preparation useful for narrowing the search is the neonatal opossum. The spinal cord and optic nerve can regenerate after injury at 9 days but cannot at 12 days after birth. This narrow window allows genes responsible for the turning off of regeneration to be identified. As a next step, sites at which they are expressed (forebrain, midbrain, spinal cord, neurons or glia, intracellular or extracellular) must be determined. An essential step is to characterize proteins, their levels of expression, and their importance for regeneration. Comprehensive searches for molecular mechanisms represent a lengthy series of experiments that could help in devising strategies for repairing injured spinal cord."

Patients were diagnosed with hepatitis D on the basis of detectable viral antibodies and the presence of HDV-RNA in their serum. A liver biopsy was performed in all cases and fibrosis staging was performed in accordance with the METAVIR scoring system. All eligible patients were administered peg-interferon at a weekly dosage of 1.5 μg/kg body weight for 48 wk. HDV-RNA was assayed at the end of this treatment period and again at 24 wk later. A biochemical response was determined by a normalization of SGPT at the end of the treatment or during follow up. The end of treatment response was defined by a HDV-RNA negative status. A sustained virological response was defined by undetectable serum HDV-RNA at six months after the end of treatment. RESULTS: Among the 277 patients enrolled in our present study, 238 completed a course of peg-interferon therapy of which 180 (75.6%) were male and 58 (24.4%) female. Biochemical responses were achieved in 122/238 (51.3%) patients. End of treatment responses were achieved in 71/238 (29.8%) cases. A SVR was achieved in 70 of these patients (29.4%).

Thousands of gays came together, and by the end of the week more than 200,000 marched through the streets of Rome's historical centre. This unique event provides an opportunity to examine the causal relationship of the gay movement acquiring a political identity of its own while the city of Rome was trying to assert a 'proper' identity for its public spaces. Acting in solidarity for the first time since its formation, the gay movement drew attention to the difficulties in securing unrestricted access to Rome's public spaces. Conservative sectors of society challenged the right to demonstrate, as guaranteed in Italy's Constitution, which resulted in the delay of obtaining the necessary permit. On the one hand, this revealed the existence of sectors of society not yet willing to acknowledge gay rights or even discuss gay issues in public; on the other, it helped make clear that the process for building Rome's identity is governed by a specific political design. In particular, policies for the privatisation of urban space in conjunction with discriminatory planning processes in the city's historical centre, point to tourism as a powerful tool to control urban space.

RAIR were absent in 4 patients preoperatively and in 12 (χ2 = 4.947, P = 0.026) patients at month 3 after surgery. RAIR was absent only in 5 patients at postoperative month 6 (χ2 = 0.141, P = 0.707). Endosonography demonstrated that IAS disruption occurred in 8 patients, and 6 patients had temporary incontinence to flatus that was normalized by postoperative month 3. IAS thickness decreased from 1.9 ± 0.6 mm preoperatively to 1.3 ± 0.4 mm (1.9 ± 0.6 mm vs 1.3 ± 0.4 mm, P = 0.000) at postoperative month 3 and increased to 1.8 ± 0.5 mm (1.9 ± 0.6 mm vs 1.8 ± 0.5 mm, P = 0.239) at postoperative month 6. EAS thickness decreased from 3.7 ± 0.6 mm preoperatively to 3.5 ± 0.3 mm (3.7 ± 0.6 mm vs 3.5 ± 0.3 mm, P = 0.510) at month 3 and then increased to 3.6 ± 0.4 mm (3.7 ± 0.6 mm vs 3.6 ± 0.4 mm, P = 0.123) at month 6 after operation. Most patients had frequent stools per day and relatively high Wexner scores in a short time period. While actual fecal incontinence was exceptional, episodes of soiling were reported by 3 patients. With regard to the QoL, the physical and mental health status scores (SF-36) were 56.1 and 46.2 (50 in the general population), respectively.

2-s2.0-1442304812.xml,"Mathematical models of fatigue and performance are potentially powerful tools to predict the effects of duty-rest schedules in many situations. Most current models, including the Circadian Alertness Simulator (CAS), derive from the two-process theory of sleep regulation. In these models, performance and fatigue are determined by a homeostatic process that depends solely on sleep/wake history, and a circadian process, driven by the biological clock. These models assume: 1) performance capability recovers in an exponential manner during sleep; 2) the homeostatic and circadian processes are additive. Current evidence suggests that both assumptions require modification. An attractive feature of the CAS is that it computes alertness curves for individuals, based on individual sleep/wake histories and other data. However, statistical evaluation is usually based on group data, with few performance metrics. As in other models, there is no substantive theory to connect the alertness computation with specific cognitive or psychomotor functions."

The most important amino sugars in soil are glucosamine, galactosamine, muramic acid, and mannosamine. A method was developed for the simultaneous determination of these four amino sugars by high-performance reverse-phase liquid chromatography in standard solutions, soil and root hydrolysates. Pre-column derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) was used in an automated sample injector with thermostatic regulation of the reagent at 4°C. The separation of the four amino sugars was fully satisfactory and was not disturbed by other fluorescent components in the soil and root hydrolysates."

The main idea is to extend approaches used in the case of visualization of phenomena of static nature into an environment where dynamic phenomena are investigated and visualized. We introduced the ""level of detail"" approach in time scaling in the environment of dynamic processes where time plays a primary role. In the case of visualization of dynamic phenomena the users are looking for specific dynamic patterns that should help them to understand in a better way the nature of dynamic processes under investigation. A new approach that should meet these requirements has been developed. This approach has been verified by means of two systems used for simulation and visualization of technological processes that are of a dynamic nature."

After transplant, these patients may need surgery for common diseases and for problems caused by immunosuppression. The purpose of this study was to determine surgical outcomes heart and lung transplant patients after transplantation. Methods All patients in the cardiopulmonary transplant registry were reviewed. Data collected included sex, age at transplantation, age at subsequent procedure, number and type of surgical procedures performed, number and type of postoperative complications, grade of complications (using the Clavien classification), and outcome (discharge to home, disabled, dead). Results During a 15-year period, 222 (64%) of 345 heart or lung transplant patients underwent a surgical procedure. Seven hundred fifty-four procedures were performed (median 3 procedures/patient). Sixty-seven patients suffered 72 complications (10% complication rate). Twenty-one (29%) complications were grade I; 20 (28%) were grade IIA; 21 (29%) were grade IIB; 8 (11%) were grade III; and 2 (3%) were grade IV. Twelve percent of the complications in the heart transplant patients were cardiac in nature, whereas 0% of the complications in the lung transplant patients were pulmonary in nature. There were 475 (63%) discharges to home, 2 (0.2%) inpatient deaths, and 18 (2%) deaths within 30 days; 49 (7%) procedures resulted in disability; and 210 (28%) patients were lost to follow-up. Conclusions Heart or lung transplant patients will frequently need subsequent surgical procedures. Overall, the patients tolerated the procedures well, and the morbidity and mortality rates were acceptable. Most complications were not related to the transplanted organ. © 2004 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

Patients and methods. - Retrospective study of 50 consecutive patients operated for a clinical presumption of endometriosis nodule of the recto vaginal septum. Thirty-nine patients had a MRI, 31 an ARES and 28 both exams. All the patients had a complete dissection of the rectovaginal septum and all lesions were excised. Results. - For the diagnosis of rectovaginal septum endometriosis nodule, MRI results are: sensitivity 73%, specificity 50%, positive predictive value (PPV) 89%, negative predictive value (NPV) 25%; for uterosacral ligaments involvement: sensitivity 84%, specificity 95%, PPV 94%, NPV 86% and for rectal wall infiltration: sensitivity 53%, specificity 82%, PPV 69%, NPV 69%. The ARES results for diagnosis of rectovaginal septum endometriosis nodule are: sensitivity 93%, specificity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 50% and for rectal wall infiltration: sensitivity 100%, specificity 71%, PPV 81%, NPV 100%. ARES appeared more sensitive than MRI for the detection of rectal wall infiltration (P = 0.002) and for rectovaginal septum endometriosis nodule diagnosis (P = 0.03). Eighty-nine percent of the patients had a coelioscopy in first intention and 15 laparoconversions were performed, 11 in order to perform a digestive resection: 45 nodules were found. In 43cases the nodule was excised, associated to 19 digestive resections, 30 colpectomys, and 22 uterosacral ligaments resections. Three patients required an additional surgical treatment by Hartman's procedure with Mickulicz's drainage for peritonitis. Forty-one nodules were endometriosis nodules: the two other cases were fibrosis nodules. Thirty-three patients were interviewed about the evolution of their pains over a mean history of 20 months: 90% of the patients were satisfied with the management results. Discussion and conclusions. - Our data support the efficiency of MRI for rectovaginal septum endometriosis nodule and uterosacral ligaments involvement diagnosis; accord ARES to rectovaginal septum endometriosis nodule diagnosis and its reliability in establishing a diagnosis of rectal wall involvement. The surgical cure of rectovaginal septum nodules without digestive infiltration is performed by coelioscopic or coelio-vaginal procedure, but in case of associated digestive affliction, laparotomy is actually the standard procedure in order to achieve a complete cure of the lesions. Complications, in particular peritonitis, are not frequent. Our data support the efficiency of radical surgical treatment for the improvement of pain symptoms. Results on fertility seem to be satisfactory, but complication risks suggest being careful in this indication. Clinical examination during a catamenial period is essential in order to evoke the diagnosis. MRI yields a complete map of the sub-peritoneal and peritoneal lesions and ARES allows for the diagnosis of an infiltration of the rectal wall. Pre-operative association of those two exams is actually indispensable for the surgical management of those patients, which consists of complete excision of endometriosical lesions and is efficient at treating pain symptoms and fertility. Complications are rare but severe, therefore, justifying a cure in specialised centres. © 2003 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits réservé s."

Despite their importance, the vast majority of fungi have not yet been isolated and identified. Due to the difficulties inherent in culture-based methods, fungal ecologists have turned to community fingerprinting techniques, which utilise signal molecules to profile the fungal members of an environmental sample without culturing. Commonly used signal molecules include chitin, ergosterol, membrane lipids, and nucleic acids. Several DNA-based fingerprinting methods have been successfully applied to fungal communities, including D/TGGE (denaturing/temperature gradient gel electrophoresis), SSCP (single-stranded conformational polymorphism), RISA (ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis), and T-RFLP (terminal restriction length fragment polymorphism). These techniques allow the fungal ecologist to rapidly profile fungal populations in an ecosystem, without the need for laborious culturing or cloning."

This restriction gives rise to a natural notion of adjacency. We show that a language based on ordered types can use this property to give an exact account of the layout of data in memory. The fuse constructor from ordered logic describes adjacency of values in memory, and the mobility modal describes pointers into the heap. We choose a particular allocation model based on a common implementation scheme for copying garbage collection and show how this permits us to separate out the allocation and initialization of memory locations in such a way as to account for optimizations such as the coalescing of multiple calls to the allocator."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hand circulation of 30 patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting was assessed by means of the modified Allen test and Doppler ultrasonography dynamic test. The test was performed by recording the flow in the superficial palmar branch of the radial and ulnar arteries with and without compression of the radial artery. In the postoperative period hemodynamic changes in the ulnar artery were also detected by means of Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: Among the 30 patients, one had abnormal and the other 29 had normal Doppler ultrasonography dynamic test results. All the patients' modified Allen test results were also normal. In 14 patients radial artery graft was used in the coronary artery bypass operation. CONCLUSION: Doppler ultrasonography dynamic test is an effective and noninvasive method in the preoperative evaluation of the hand collateral circulation for the safe removal of a radial artery graft."

Product introduction within an extended enterprise demands close co-operation between different participants such as companies, departments, groups/teams, and individuals. The different participants' internal goals will influence the ability to attain a joint goal for the product introduction. This paper presents some of the different internal goals for product introduction, the conflicts that they can result in, and ways to overcome these. It is based on two case studies performed in two manufacturing extended enterprises in Sweden, one within the electronic industry and one within the mechanical engineering industry. The main conclusions are that working with product introduction within extended enterprises demands a trustful relation between the different participants and that it is extremely beneficial to involve production engineers as early as in the conceptual design phase for new products."

Experimental results for the jitter under different loading conditions have been obtained. Those results show the effect of background load, number of background sources, and number of hops. The captured data is used as input to the simulator. The proposed algorithm is introduced to solve the ATM cell jitter problem. The CBR jitter is adjusted according to the mean value of the Cell Interarrival Time (CIT), T. Each cell takes its previous cell as a reference to calculated its adjusted delay. The system stores the cell in a buffer and delivers it after time T from the previous cell. In our analysis, we assume that the buffer size is unlimited as in D/D/1 queuing system. The simulation shows great deal of jitter performance improvement using the proposed algorithm."

Two additional PCR-ELISA assays were developed to validate the results: one, based on the detection of the maize alcohol dehydrogenase 1 promoter specifically detected the presence of maize, and the other, based on the detection of a conserved sequence of plants (255 ribosomal RNA gene), validated the extracted DNA amplification. The PCR-ELISA assays developed here were highly specific and found to be as sensitive as the reference Southern hybridisation assay. The PCR-ELISA tests were at least 6 times more sensitive than gel electrophoresis and allowed 0.1% GMOs to be detected in Bt176, Bt11, Mon810 maize and Roundup Ready soybean. The PCR-ELISA tests are a method of choice for GMO screening and identifying Bt176 maize in flours and native starches. They may offer a cheaper alternative to the expensive real-time PCR assays and may be useful in laboratory GMO monitoring."

2-s2.0-1442289306.xml,"Single scattering optical properties are calculated for a proxy of fine dust aerosols at a wavelength of 0.55 μm. Spherical and spheroidal model particles are employed to fit the aerosol optical properties and to retrieve information about the physical parameters characterising the aerosols. It is found that spherical particles are capable of reproducing the scalar optical properties and the forward peak of the phase function of the dust aerosols. The effective size parameter of the aerosol ensemble is retrieved with high accuracy by using spherical model particles. Significant improvements are achieved by using spheroidal model particles. The aerosol phase function and the other diagonal elements of the Stokes scattering matrix can be fitted with high accuracy, whereas the off-diagonal elements are poorly reproduced. More elongated prolate and more flattened oblate spheroids contribute disproportionately strongly to the optimised shape distribution of the model particles and appear to be particularly useful for achieving a good fit of the scattering matrix. However, the clear discrepancies between the shape distribution of the aerosols and the shape distribution of the spheroidal model particles suggest that the possibilities of extracting shape information from optical observations are rather limited. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

These risks can never be eliminated, but can be reduced by using probability methods at different stages of assessment and exploration activities. Probabilistic modeling of the historical discovery trends (discovery process) and of the spatial-temporal relationships between deposit characteristics (size, number) and geology (play analysis) has been accepted as effective methods for evaluating future discoveries, because of their capability of incorporating specific quantitative geological, technological and economic attributes related to exploration. The two major geological uncertainties that play a key role are related to the nature of parent statistical distributions of number and sizes of the fields in a given region of assessment. Statistical distributions of geological parameters can be estimated using Monte Carlo methods, taking care of the correlations, to produce field size distribution in the play or basin. Similarly, distribution of possible number of fields can be estimated incorporating also the drilling parameters.

The exact pathogenesis is not clear, but an involvement of factors such as bile duct compression by venous collaterals, ischemia, and infection is accepted by most authors. Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was used to define and diagnose this condition, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is currently the investigation of choice for diagnosing this condition. Treatment is indicated only for symptomatic cases. Portosystemic shunts are the treatment of choice for symptomatic portal biliopathy. In the majority of patients, the changes caused by biliopathy resolve after shunt surgery, however, 15%-20% patients require a subsequent bilio-enteric bypass or endoscopic management for persistent biliopathy.

2-s2.0-84873911901.xml,"AIM: To study the coincidence of celiac disease, we tested its serological markers in patients with various liver diseases. METHODS: Large-scale screening of serum antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG), and deamidated gliadin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and serum antibodies against endomysium using immunohistochemistry, in patients with various liver diseases (n = 962) and patients who underwent liver transplantation (OLTx, n = 523) was performed. The expression of tTG in liver tissue samples of patients simultaneously suffering from celiac disease and from various liver diseases using immunohistochemistry was carried out. The final diagnosis of celiac disease was confirmed by histological analysis of small-intestinal biopsy. RESULTS: We found that 29 of 962 patients (3%) with liver diseases and 5 of 523 patients (0.8%) who underwent OLTx were seropositive for IgA and IgG anti-tTG antibodies. However, celiac disease was biopsy-diagnosed in 16 patients: 4 with autoimmune hepatitis type I, 3 with Wilson's disease, 3 with celiac hepatitis, 2 with primary sclerosing cholangitis, 1 with primary biliary cirrhosis, 1 with Budd-Chiari syndrome, 1 with toxic hepatitis, and 1 with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Unexpectedly, the highest prevalence of celiac disease was found in patients with Wilson's disease (9.7%), with which it is only rarely associated. On the other hand, no OLTx patients were diagnosed with celiac disease in our study. A pilot study of the expression of tTG in liver tissue using immunohistochemistry documented the overexpression of this molecule in endothelial cells and periportal hepatocytes of patients simultaneously suffering from celiac disease and toxic hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis or autoimmune hepatitis type I. CONCLUSION: We suggest that screening for celiac disease may be beneficial not only in patients with associated liver diseases, but also in patients with Wilson's disease. © 2012 Baishideng.

2-s2.0-1642292283.xml,"Simulations in the authors' previous studies have shown that a modified temperature integration regime with a 6-day averaging period and increased set-point flexibility was able to reduce annual energy consumption by up to 9% as compared to a regular temperature integration regime. The commonly applied fixed set-point for relative humidity (RH) of 80-85% strongly reduced the potential for energy saving with this regime. Therefore, a more flexible humidity control regime was developed. Simulations indicated that yearly energy consumption could be reduced by 18% as compared to a fixed set-point of 80% RH. By combining the two regimes (temperature integration and humidity control), it was predicted that the energy saving would be even greater. To test this prediction, the combined regimes were applied in two experiments with cut-flower chrysanthemum crops investigating the effect on plant development and growth. Different temperature bandwidths for temperature integration (±2, ±4, ±6 and ±8°C) were also compared within the joint regime. Crop development was only delayed with the ±8°C temperature bandwidth. The best regime with respect to plant development, growth, quality and energy saving (±6°C temperature bandwidth) was compared in a spring experiment with a climate regime used in commercial practice. Energy consumption was 23.5% less with the joint regime. No negative consequences of high humidity were observed, but there was a strong increase in the dry weight of all plant organs. Total plant dry weight was 39% higher than in the regular regime. It can be concluded that energy saving and crop yield increase can be achieved simultaneously, although the dynamic temperature control has to be adjusted to the chrysanthemum developmental stage. The combined dynamic climate regime forms a promising basis for future climate controllers and is easily extendable to other greenhouse crops. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-1642418279.xml,"Every company makes choices about the channels it will use to go to market. Traditionally, the decision to sell through a discount superstore or a pricey boutique, for instance, was guided by customer demographics. A company would identify a target segment of buyers and go with the channel that could deliver them. It was a fair assumption that certain customer types were held captive by certain channels-if not from cradle to grave, then at least from initial consideration to purchase. The problem, the authors say, is that today's customers have become unfettered. As their channel options have proliferated, they've come to recognize that different channels serve their needs better at different points in the buying process. The result is ""value poaching."" For example, certain channels hope to use higher margin sales to cover the cost of providing expensive high-touch services. Potential customers use these channels to do research, then leap to a cheaper channel when it's time to buy. Customers now hunt for bargains more aggressively; they've become more sophisticated about how companies market to them; and they are better equipped with information and technology to make advantageous decisions. What does this mean for your go-to-market strategy? The authors urge companies to make a fundamental shift in mindset toward designing for buyer behaviors, not customer segments.

When there is no associated pathology, however, the onset of age-related change is slow and of low impact. Change concerns the bones, muscles, mucosa, salivary glands, teeth, and the senses of smell and taste. As a consequence, the functions of mastication and swallowing are also altered. In geriatric dentistry age is not the only factor that should be taken into account, however, as other pathologies associated with ageing play an extremely important role. Many studies have reported correlation between oral health and certain other pathologies, or between oral health and mortality. Clear cause and effect relationships are difficult to establish, however, particularly in terms of dental status and nutrition. Decreased masticatory efficiency, particularly that associated with loss of teeth, compromises choice of food types and increases the risk of an unbalanced diet with its subsequent effect on general health. Knowledge and recognition of the evolution of oral function with age and its repercussions on general health, leads to a call for closer collaboration between physicians, nutritionists, geriatricians and dental surgeons."
2-s2.0-1542790007.xml,"Complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs) are usually associated with infertility or subfertility in male carriers. If fertility is maintained, there is a high risk of abnormal pregnancy outcome. Few male carriers have been identified by children presenting with mental retardation/congenital malformations (MR/CM) or by spontaneous abortions of the spouses. We report a de novo CCR with five breakpoints involving chromosomes 4, 10 and 14 in a male carrier who was ascertained through a son presenting with MR/CM due to an unbalanced karyotype with partial trisomy 14 and partial monosomy 4. The child has a healthy elder brother. In the family history no abortions were reported. No fertility treatment was necessary. Cytogenetic analysis from the affected son showed a reciprocal translocation t(4;10) with additional chromosomal material inserted between the translocation junctions in the derivative chromosome 10. The father showed the same derivative chromosome 10 but had additionally one aberrant chromosome 14. Further molecular cytogenetic analyses determined the inserted material in the aberrant chromosome 10 as derived from chromosome 14 and revealed a small translocation with material of chromosome 4 inserted into the derivative chromosome 14. Thus the phenotype of the son is supposed to be associated with a partial duplication 14q13→q24.1 and a partial monosomy 4q27→q28. Including our case we are aware of eleven CCR cases with fertile male carriers. In eight of these families normal offspring have been reported. We propose that exceptional CCRs in fertile male carriers might form comparatively simple pachytene configurations increasing the chance of healthy offspring. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel."

In this report, we investigated the effect of colonic bacteria on epithelial cell differentiation factors in vitro and in vivo. As key transcription factors we focused on Hes1, known to direct towards an absorptive cell fate, Hath1 and KLF4, which govern goblet cell. Methods: Expression of the transcription factors Hes1, Hath1 and KLF4, the mucins Muc1 and Muc2 and the defensin HBD2 were measured by real-time PCR in LS174T cells following incubation with several heat-inactivated E. coli strains, including the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917+/- flagellin, Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. For protein detection Western blot experiments and chamber-slide immunostaining were performed. Finally, mRNA and protein expression of these factors was evaluated in the colon of germfree vs. specific pathogen free vs. conventionalized mice and colonic goblet cells were counted. Results: Expression of Hes1 and Hath1, and to a minor degree also of KLF4, was reduced by E. coli K-12 and E. coli Nissle 1917. In contrast, Muc1 and HBD2 expression were significantly enhanced, independent of the Notch signalling pathway. Probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 regulated Hes1, Hath1, Muc1 and HBD2 through flagellin. In vivo experiments confirmed the observed in vitro effects of bacteria by a diminished colonic expression of Hath1 and KLF4 in specific pathogen free and conventionalized mice as compared to germ free mice whereas the number of goblet cells was unchanged in these mice. Conclusions: Intestinal bacteria influence the intestinal epithelial differentiation factors Hes1, Hath1 and KLF4, as well as Muc1 and HBD2, in vitro and in vivo. The induction of Muc1 and HBD2 seems to be triggered directly by bacteria and not by Notch. © 2013 Becker et al."
2-s2.0-1642337952.xml,"When environments differentially influence male and female performance, environmental sex determination (ESD) might evolve. The conclusion from several previous theoretical models was that reaction norms for sex determination should have a single, sharp threshold, with only females being produced in some environments and only males in others. These reaction norms can be disadvantageous in fluctuating environments, however, because they lead to sex-ratio fluctuations. We analysed the evolution of ESD, looking for equilibrium strategies in unconstrained as well as constrained strategy spaces. We identified situations where a single-threshold reaction norm is not evolutionarily stable. In these cases, we found stable strategies in the form of complex reaction norms, showing an oscillatory pattern of sex determination with respect to variation in an environmental variable. Considering that constraints could prevent such phenotypes from being realized, we found that certain randomized reaction norms, with probabilistic sex determination for a range of environments, would achieve nearly the same fitness. We also investigated reaction norms constrained to have a single threshold and found that genetic polymorphism in the environmental threshold value could evolve, producing a similar effect as a randomized reaction norm. We argue that the appearance of genetic variation can be regarded as an alternative outcome when constraints prevent the evolution of a more complex or a randomized strategy. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Five-year survival between countries was compared for all malignancies and for the major diagnostic categories, adjusting for age, and estimated average European survival weighting for differences in childhood populations. Results: For all cancers combined, survival variation was large (45% in Estonia to 90% in Iceland), and was generally low (60-70%) in eastern Europe and high (≥75%) in Switzerland, Germany and the Nordic countries (except Denmark). The Nordic countries had the highest survival for four of the seven major tumour types: nephroblastoma (92%), acute lymphoid leukaemia (85%), CNS tumours (73%) and acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (62%). The eastern countries had lowest survival: 89% for Hodgkin's disease, 71% for nephroblastoma, 68% for acute lymphoid leukaemia, 61% for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 57% for central nervous system (CNS) tumours and 29% for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. Conclusions: The Nordic countries represent a survival gold standard to which other countries can aspire. Since most childhood cancers respond well to treatment, survival differences are attributable to differences in access (including referral and timely diagnosis) and use of modern treatments; however, the obstacles to access and application of standard treatments probably vary markedly with country. © 2003 European Society for Medical Oncology."

2-s2.0-1542315965.xml,"The inherent complexity of numerous industrial processes in the metallurgical industry poses formidable technical challenges for modeling, design and simulation: consequently, it is exceptionally difficult not only to optimize the operation of traditional plants without extensive experimentation, but also to model and analyze the feasibility and profitability of various novel designs proposed. Most metallurgical unit operations encompass a wide spectrum of phenomena (convection, diffusion, reaction, external field effects) that often occur simultaneously in multiphase configurations. Accurate modeling of complex distributed chemical processes entails the use of partial differential equation (PDE) descriptions which can now be routinely handled using commercial solvers; an attractive feature of the latter is a potential to handle combinations of diverse physical phenomena that occur in complex processes and yield highly coupled nonlinear PDE mathematical models. Thus, detailed steady state simulations of metallurgical processes can be obtained via advanced interactive software environments. A steady state sensitivity analysis of state variable distributions (namely, potential, absolute temperature and molten slag velocity) with respect to a key design variable (imposed electrode voltage) is performed for a conceptual carbothermic reduction reactor proposed by Johansen et al. (2000) for production of aluminium. Simultaneous solution of charge, heat and momentum balances on a suitably simplified two-dimensional computational domain representing a section of this reactor is used to achieve the goal of this work, which is to study trends important in efficient design. The major conclusion of the present CFD sensitivity study is that the voltage imposed on the horizontal heating electrode pairs affects the interplay between heat conduction and convection, thus the topography and uniformity of the temperature distribution. The electrode voltage has been qualitatively proved to govern the location and size of high-temperature regions in the reactor, thus affecting the advance of the quite endothermic carbothermic reduction reaction as well as the per volume reactor productivity. Therefore, electrode voltage is a crucial reactor design parameter that can also be used very conveniently as a manipulation variable for the efficient operation and control of a carbothermic reactor."

2-s2.0-1542347184.xml,"Model checking is an automated technique for verifying that a system satisfies a set of required properties. Such properties are typically expressed as temporal logic formulas, in which atomic propositions are predicates over state variables of the system. In event-based system descriptions, states are not characterized by state variables, but rather by the behavior that originates in these states in terms of actions. In this context, it is natural for temporal formulas to be built from atomic propositions that are predicates on the occurrence of actions. The paper identifies limitations in this approach and introduces ""fluent"" propositions that permit formulas to naturally express properties that combine state and action. A fluent is a property of the world that holds after it is initiated by an action and ceases to hold when terminated by another action. The paper describes an approach to model checking fluent-based linear-temporal logic properties, with its implementation and application in the LTSA tool."

The cost-weighting depends both on the instantaneous position and direction of motion. We propose an algorithm for the computation of shortest-path that reduces the problem to an optimization over a finite graph. This algorithm restricts the search to paths formed by the concatenation of straight-line segments between points, from a suitably chosen discretization of the continuous region. To maximize efficiency, the discretization of the continuous region should not be uniform. We propose a novel ""honeycomb"" sampling algorithm that minimizes the cost penalty introduced by discretization. The resulting path is not optimal but the cost penalty can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computation. This methodology is applied to the computation of paths for groups of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) that minimize the risk of being destroyed by ground defenses. We show that this problem can be formulated as a weighted anisotropic shortest-path optimization and show that the algorithm proposed can efficiently produce low-risk paths."

Our investigations indicate that customer orientation practices primarily affect time-based efficiency, while process improvement efforts help cost-related performance. On the other hand, emphasizing process-control systems leads to customer satisfaction directly without necessarily improving operations. While supporting the basic assertions of the classical quality management theory, these findings reveal that several problems exist in the practice of quality management in industry, and suggest that a re-direction of several quality management practices seems necessary.

Endothelial dysfunction was identified both in the experiment and in patients after herpes virus simplex 1 infection, cytomegaloviral infection, Chlamydia pneumoniae infection, or Helicobacter pylori infection. However, it is not clear whether it is always caused by direct specific activity of a given pathogen or whether it is a result of inflammatory cytokines activity, heat shock protein activity, or CRP activity. In recent years secondary antibiotic prevention in patients after myocardial infarction has been discussed. Lower mortality rate from acute myocardial infarction and cerebral vascular accidents were found in several observations of patients vaccinated against influenza.

This retrospective case-control study describes the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of referrals (n=149) to the State Hospital during a 12-month period, and delineates differences between admitted (n=57) and rejected (n=92) patients. The referrals had an average age of 31.1 years, and were mostly male (86.6%), single (64.4%) and unemployed (90.6%). Admitted patients were more likely to have a criminal history, to be psychotic, to have a family history of mental disorder and to be viewed by the assessor as having psychotic beliefs which contributed to the behaviour or alleged offence leading to the referral. Rejected patients were more likely to have been remanded to prison or assessed by specialist registrars. Patients admitted to high security psychiatric care are more likely to show dangerous behaviour secondary to psychosis. These findings are in keeping with the requirements of mental health legislation and the admissions policy."

2-s2.0-1642451752.xml,"The reagent database dbMHC was built by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as an open resource for registration and characterization of HLA DNA-typing kits and reagents. Each reagent is uniquely identified as sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) or primer (SSP), SSO mix, or SSP mix. Computerized prediction of allele reactivities, based on annealing stringency, is performed on all submissions to the reagent database. User-specified allele reactivities may be added or deleted independently of the prediction algorithm. Updates of allele reactivities are performed in synchronization with the IMGT/HLA database, in order to account for newly discovered alleles. Probe and primer sequences aligned to allelic sequences can be displayed at any time. Reagents registered in the reagent database are grouped in typing kits. Each kit or kit batch is uniquely identified. Group-specific amplification of alleles can be specified for an entire kit or for sections of each kit. Kits designed to test multiple loci are supported. Kits can be entered and updated via the web or submitted as batches in extensible markup language (XML) format. A tool for online interpretation of typing results is available. Both the reagent database and the typing kit database have been designed to facilitate the exchange of HLA typing based on raw typing data using the unique identifiers of kits or individual reagents. In addition, batch-wise reinterpretation of previous typing data can be performed either using the NCBI web site or by locally using downloaded allele-reactivity lists. Reinterpretation by the NCBI requires submission of raw typing data in XML format."

This approach combines theory of learning automata with fuzzy logic theory. We call these automata the F type learning automata. Well known learning automata of P, Q and S types are special cases of this F type automata. We prove that these automata are strictly distance diminishing. Efficiency of the three combination of fuzzy t and s norms: min-max, product-algebraic sum and drastic product-drastic sum has been evaluated as well. Simulation results of the circuit switched telecommunication network obtained whereby two criteria: quality and price, have been taken into account simultaneously have shown superiority of product-algebraic combination of fuzzy norms under nominal and overloaded network conditions in comparison to another tested norms. The influence of a period in which F automaton updates its action probabilities based on fuzzy environment feedback on the network gain has been investigated as well."

This paper addresses major usability issues in a previous version of CCured, in which many type casts required the use of pointers whose representation was expensive and incompatible with precompiled libraries. We have extended the CCured type inference algorithm to recognize and verify statically a large number of type casts; this goal is achieved by using physical subtyping and pointers with run-time type information to allow parametric and subtype polymorphism. In addition, we present a new instrumentation scheme that splits CCured's metadata into a separate data structure whose shape mirrors that of the original user data. This scheme allows instrumented programs to invoke external functions directly on the program's data without the use of a wrapper function. With these extensions we were able to use CCured on real-world security-critical network daemons and to produce instrumented versions without memory-safety vulnerabilities."
2-s2.0-84873926641.xml,"AIM: To analyze the effectiveness of the endoscopic therapy and to identify prognostic factors for recurrent bleeding. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to Dieulafoy's lesion (DL) from 2005 to 2011. We analyzed the demographic characteristics of the patients, risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, endoscopic findings, characteristics of the endoscopic treatment, and the recurrence of bleeding. We included cases in which endoscopy described a lesion compatible with Dieulafoy. We excluded patients who had potentially bleeding lesions such as angiodysplasia in other areas or had undergone other gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with DL were identified. Most of them were men with an average age of 71.5 years. Fifty-five percent of the patients received antiaggregatory or anticoagulant therapy. The most common location for DL was the stomach (51.7%). The main type of bleeding was oozing in 65.5% of cases. In 27.6% of cases, there was arterial (spurting) bleeding, and 6.9% of the patients presented with an adherent clot. A single endoscopic treatment was applied to nine patients (31%); eight of them with adrenaline and one with argon, while 69% of the patients received combined treatment. Six patients (20.7%) presented with recurrent bleeding at a median of 4 d after endoscopy (interquartile range = 97.75). Within these six patients, the new endoscopic treatment obtained a therapeutic success of 100%. The presence of arterial bleeding at endoscopy was associated with a higher recurrence rate for bleeding (50% vs 33.3% for other type of bleeding) [P = 0.024, odds ratio (OR) = 8.5, 95% CI = 1.13-63.87]. The use of combined endoscopic treatment prevented the recurrence of bleeding (10% vs 44.4% of single treatment) (P = 0.034, OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.19-0.99). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic treatment of DL is safe and effective. Adrenaline monotherapy and arterial (spurting) bleeding are associated with a high rate of bleeding recurrence. © 2012 Baishideng.

In this paper we first describe a polynomial-time algorithm that determines whether any given set of molecules, reactions and catalysations contains a subsystem that is both autocatalytic and able to be sustained from a given subset of the molecules. We also describe some combinatorial properties of this algorithm, and show how it can be used to find irreducible auto-catalysing and sustaining subsystems. In the second part of the paper we use the algorithm to investigate random catalytic networks - in particular, a model described by Kauffman.

Current cell-based assays for MCP-1 use monocyte chemotaxis or calcium flux as a readout. Here, we describe an alternative bioassay based on MCP-1-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p44 (ERK1) and p42 (ERK2). Adherent cells expressing the MCP-1 receptor CCR2B are treated with MCP-1 in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of inhibitors, fixed and permeabilized with methanol, and then probed with a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes the doubly phosphorylated form of p44/42 MAPK. Bound antibody is detected with a secondary antibody-peroxidase conjugate and a chromogenic substrate. The phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK as detected in this assay peaks after 3-5min of MCP-1 treatment, and the concentration of MCP-1 required for half-maximal p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation is 1-3nM. MCP-1-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK is dependent upon the expression of CCR2B. The assay can be used for screening and characterization of small molecule inhibitors and antibodies blocking the binding of MCP-1 to its receptor. Since the assay is rapid and simple, it may represent a useful alternative to chemotaxis or calcium mobilization assays for the analysis of MCP-1 inhibitors. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

They were randomly assigned to receive 0.8 mL/kg of plain local anesthetic mixture (lidocaine 1% + bupivacaine 0.25% (50/50) + 1 μg/mL of fentanyl) or 1 mL/kg of the same mixture with 5 μg/mL of adrenaline. No significant hemodynamic alteration was elicited in caudal and thoracolumbar groups receiving the plain mixture except a moderate decrease in heart rate. Conversely, a mixture with adrenaline added provoked a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure by 14% and 17%, in systemic vascular resistance by 24% and 40%, and an increase in cardiac output by 20% and 34% in caudal and thoracolumbar groups, respectively.

Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis revealed three main profile types (A, B and C) for parasites isolated from scallops. Sequence analysis revealed that samples represented by profiles B and C had a high degree (97.3%) of sequence similarity, whereas they were ∼21% different in sequence from those represented by profile A. These findings suggested that at least two types or species (represented by profile A, or profile B or C) of bucephalid infect scallops, of which both were detected in South Australia, while only one was found in Victoria. The prevalence of bucephalids (and their SSCP haplotypes) appeared to differ among the three species of scallop in South Australia as well as between the two scallop species in Victoria, indicating a degree of host specificity. Adult bucephalids were collected from Eastern Australian Salmon (Arripis trutta), in an attempt to match them with the asexual stages from the scallop hosts. Neither of the two taxa of adult bucephalid (Telorhynchus arripidis and an un-named Telorhynchus species) shared SSCP profiles with the bucephalids from scallops, but were genetically similar, suggesting that the asexual stages from scallops may represent the genus Telorhynchus.

However, employee governance is rare in advanced market economies due to its relative inefficiency compared with shareholder governance. Given this inefficiency, should employee governance be given up as an impractical ideal? This article contends that the debate over this question is hampered by an inadequate conception of employee governance that fails to take into account the difference between employees and shareholders. It offers a different, more adequate conception of employee governance that recognizes a sense in which employees currently have some ownership rights. The argument for this conception of employee governance is built on an expanded understanding of the ownership of a firm. The article also suggests new strategies for strengthening the role of employees in corporate governance."

2-s2.0-1542291791.xml,"Apart from control of the seizures, two of the most important factors in determining how well a child with epilepsy progresses toward independence are cognition and behavior. The diagnosis of the correct epilepsy syndrome often provides information with regard to probability of good seizure control and intellectual outcome. However, relatively little has been published on the behavioral aspects of the various epilepsy syndromes. In West syndrome there is emerging evidence that early effective treatment might improve outcome in terms of both cognition and behavior. The work on this syndrome in children with tuberous sclerosis has demonstrated an association between temporal lobe tubers and autism. In Dravet syndrome, a variety of psychiatric disorders have been reported, including hyperactivity and autistic features. This is another epilepsy syndrome that tends to be resistant to treatment, implying that the prognosis has to be guarded. The behavioral problems reported with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome also include autistic features, as well as generally sluggish behavior. It is very likely that these characteristics largely reflect the effect of ongoing seizure activity. Autistic features, aggression, and hyperkinesis have been described with Landau-Kleffner syndrome. The behavior may improve dramatically with appropriate medical treatment or after multiple subpial transection. Although the syndrome of benign partial seizures with centrotemporal or rolandic spikes is said to have a very good prognosis, it is becoming increasingly evident that behavioral problems such as concentration difficulties, tempers, hyperactivity, and impulsivity might occur. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy has been associated with very variable behavioral traits, sometimes with immature personality features and poor social adjustment suggesting frontal lobe dysfunction. Because many of the reports of behavioral disturbance associated with epilepsy syndromes are anecdotal and do not include validated measures of behavior it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions from them at this stage. Carefully conducted prospective studies, paying particular attention to any behavioral improvements that occur with successful treatment of the epilepsy, are required. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

2-s2.0-1642398387.xml,"Proton and carbon-13 NMR spectroscopic methods were developed for determining hydrogen and carbon contents in petroleum products. These methods are applicable to a wide range of petroleum streams. A new reference standard, bis(trimethylsilyl)methane, BTMSM, is introduced for both proton and carbon-13 NMR for the first time, which offers several advantages over those customarily employed. These methods are important for the calculation of the mass balance and hydrogen consumption in pilot plant studies. Unlike the ASTM D-5291 combustion method, the NMR methods also allow for the measurement of hydrogen and carbon content in low-boiling fractions and those containing hydrogen as low as 1%. The NMR methods can also determine aromatic and aliphatic hydrogens and carbons in a given sample without additional experimentation. The precision and accuracy of the newly developed NMR methods are compared with those of currently employed ASTM D-5291 combustion method. Using the proton NMR method, hydrogen content was determined in fifteen model compounds and sixty-eight petroleum fractions. The NMR and ASTM methods show an agreement within ±5% for 48 out of a total number of 68 oil fractions. Using carbon-13 NMR, the carbon content was determined for four representative compounds and three fractions of crude oil. Both carbon-13 NMR and ASTM methods give comparable carbon content in model compounds and crude oil fractions."
2-s2.0-84873914743.xml,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been recognized as a major health burden. It is the most important cause of chronic liver disease and a major independent cardiovascular risk factor. Lacking a definite treatment for NAFLD, a specific diet and an increase in physical activity represent the most commonly used therapeutic approaches. In this review, major literature data about the use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) as a potential treatment of NAFLD have been described. n-3 PUFAs, besides having a beneficial impact on most of the cardio-metabolic risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis) by regulating gene transcription factors [i.e., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α, PPARγ, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein], impacts both lipid metabolism and on insulin sensitivity. In addition to an enhancement of hepatic beta oxidation and a decrease of the endogenous lipid production, n-3 PUFAs are able to determine a significant reduction of the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) and of oxygen reactive species. Further strengthening the results of the in vitro studies, both animal models and human intervention trials, showed a beneficial effect of n-3 PUFAs on the severity of NAFLD as expressed by laboratory parameters and imaging measurements. Despite available results provided encouraging data about the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs as a treatment of NAFLD in humans, welldesigned randomized controlled trials of adequate size and duration, with histological endpoints, are needed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of PUFA, as well as other therapies, for the treatment of NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients. It is worthwhile to consider that n-3 PUFAs cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be derived from exogenous sources (fish oil, flaxseeds, olive oil) which are typical foods of the Mediterranean diet, known for its beneficial effects in preventing obesity, diabetes and, in turn, cardiovascular events. According to these data, it is important to consider that most of the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs can also be obtained by an equilibrate nutrition program. © 2012 Baishideng.

Types and effect systems can be used to reason about continuations, both in the source language and in the target language of the continuation-passing transform. In this paper, we establish the connection between an effect system for first-class continuations and typed versions of continuation-passing style. A region in the effect system determines a local answer type for continuations, such that the continuation transforms of pure expressions are parametrically polymorphic in their answer types. We use this polymorphism to derive transforms that make use of effect information, in particular, a mixed linear/non-linear continuation-passing transform, in which expressions without control effects are passed their continuations linearly."

Direct molecular diagnosis is now possible in numerous inherited symptomatic epilepsies. Progress has also been spectacular with respect to several idiopathic epilepsies that are caused by mutations in genes encoding subunits of ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors. Although these findings concern only a few families and sporadic cases, their potential importance is great, because these genes are implicated in a wide range of more common epileptic disorders and seizure types as well as some rare syndromes. Functional studies of these mutations, while leading to further progress in the neurobiology of the epilepsies, will help to refine genotype-phenotype relations and increase our understanding of responses to antiepileptic drugs. In this article, we review the clinical and genetic data on most of the idiopathic human epilepsies and epileptic contexts in which the association of epilepsy and febrile convulsions is genetically determined."

The fuse constructor from ordered logic describes adjacency of values in memory, and the mobility modal describes pointers into the heap.

We found significant potential denitrifying activity in all the soils of the main landscape patch types of the Lake Nerka catchment. The lowest potential denitrifying activity was measured in the peat lands. A highly significant relationship was found between soil organic matter and potential denitrification activity in three landforms - coniferous flats, groundwater seeps, and riparian soils of meandering streams. These three landscape structures also had the highest denitrifying potential. The finer soils of riparian zones along spawning streams, which corresponded to meandering streams, showed a significantly higher potential denitrification activity than the coarse riparian soils along nonspawning streams. These nonspawning streams corresponded to braided streams, where finer sediments were not as prevalent. Therefore, if this high potential denitrification measured in riparian soils of spawning streams is combined with large inputs of nitrate to anaerobic sites, it can result in"

For the responsible agencies, applications of the basic biomedical and applied human factors science provide the best available solutions to help individuals perform more effectively and with increased safety. Key products of this research are biomathematical models that predict periods of impaired performance, with applications in planning tools, real time monitoring, and intervention decision aids. Since it is difficult to quantify the number of judgment errors or accidents averted, metrics of success for fatigue management systems must be largely based on the accuracy of performance predictions derived from laboratory-based research studies and the extent to which such results can be generalized to the field environment. Performance metrics must, at a minimum, be correlated with occupational task performance to demonstrate relevance to real-world applications. This paper outlines broad goals for human effectiveness research related to fatigue, alertness, and performance. To advance from the present state of knowledge to useful predictive models requires a well-coordinated commitment from federal agencies.

We conducted repeated searches for coveys and radiomarked all coveys found on 12 259-ha study areas in east-central Kansas, USA. We simulated a harvest in 6 randomly selected areas each year during November-January, 1997-2000, by trapping and removing 60% of bobwhites in each covey. We used flush counts and radiotelemetry to measure harvest effects on natural mortality rates, overall winter survival, covey size, and densities. Observed natural mortality rates of radiomarked individuals were similar between harvested (50.6 ± 4.3%) and unharvested areas (52.1 ± 4.7%). Estimated winter survival was 47.9% on the unharvested areas and 20.9% on the harvested areas. Harvest did not affect the number of coveys, average covey size, or density of bobwhites, indicating that coveys coalesced through local movement. Our results indicate that harvest is additive to natural mortality and suggest that local movement to maintain optimal group sizes can mask the true effect of harvest on observed densities in small areas."

There have been no studies to determine how and to what extent this teaching is done in physical medicine and rehabilitation training programs. Objective: To assess the state of medical-ethics teaching in Canadian physical medicine and rehabilitation residency training programs. Methods: A six-question survey was faxed to the program directors of the 10 physiatry residency training programs in Canada. We asked whether medical-ethics teaching is being done, who is doing the teaching, which pedagogic methods is used, how many hours are dedicated to the topic, which topics are taught, and what evaluation method is used. Results: The response rate was 90 per cent. The study confirmed that medical-ethics teaching is done in all Canadian physiatry training programs. However, the person doing the teaching, the number of hours allocated to ethics education, the pedagogic method used, and the topics being taught vary from program to program. Conclusion: Although medical-ethics teaching is done in all programs, there is a need for more standardization in the curriculum and in evaluation. The curriculum should focus on ethical issues that are most likely to be encountered in daily physiatric practice. Small-group, case-based teaching should be used for maximum effectiveness. Whenever possible, teaching should be done by a physiatrist."

Cut surface of the mass revealed multicystic spaces containing a milky white fluid. The patient underwent tumor removal with small-bowel resection and end-to-end anastomosis. Microscopic examination revealed that the cystic walls were lined with flat endothelial cells and comprised of smooth muscle in the walls. The flat endothelial cells were positive for factor VIII-related antigen and D2-40 but negative for calretinin. HMB-45 showed negative study in the smooth-muscle cells around the lymphatic spaces.

2-s2.0-84873931030.xml,"Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be grouped as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These conditions have become increasingly common in recent years, including in children and young people. Although much is known about aspects of the pathogenesis of these diseases, the precise aetiology is not yet understood, and there remains no cure. Recent data has illustrated the importance of a number of genes-several of these are important in the onset of IBD in early life, including in infancy. Pain, diarrhoea and weight loss are typical symptoms of paediatric Crohn's disease whereas bloody diarrhoea is more typical of colitis in children. However, atypical symptoms may occur in both conditions: these include isolated impairment of linear growth or presentation with extra-intestinal manifestations such as erythema nodosum. Growth and nutrition are commonly compromised at diagnosis in both Crohn's disease and colitis. Consideration of possible IBD and completion of appropriate investigations are essential to ensure prompt diagnosis, thereby avoiding the consequences of diagnostic delay. Patterns of disease including location and progression of IBD in childhood differ substantially from adultonset disease. Various treatment options are available for children and adolescents with IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition plays a central role in the induction of remission of active Crohn's disease. Medical and surgical therapies need to considered within the context of a growing and developing child. The overall management of these chronic conditions in children should include multi-disciplinary expertise, with focus upon maintaining control of gut inflammation, optimising nutrition, growth and quality of life, whilst preventing disease or treatment-related complications. © 2012 Baishideng.

2-s2.0-1442322523.xml,"We analyze the transmission properties of double negative metamaterials (DNM). Numerical simulations, based on the transfer matrix algorithm, show that some portion of the electromagnetic wave changes its polarization inside the DNM structure. As the transmission properties depend strongly on the polarization, this complicates the interpretation of experimental and numerical data, both inside and outside of the pass band. From the transmission data, the effective permittivity, permeability and refractive index are calculated. In the pass band, we found that the real part of permeability and both the real and the imaginary part of the permittivity are negative. Transmission data for some new structures are also shown. Of particular interest is the structure with cut wires, which possesses two double negative pass bands. © 2003 Optical Society of America."
2-s2.0-84873918090.xml,"Peliosis hepatis (PH) is a rare benign condition characterized by the presence of multiple, randomly distributed, blood filled cystic areas of variable size within the liver parenchyma. PH is difficult to recognize and may be mistaken for neoplasm, metastases or multiple abscesses. A 75-year-old female with a previous history of colon cancer was admitted when a liver mass in the right liver lobe was found 11 mo after surgery during the follow-up period. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan of the abdomen were performed. The initial possible diagnosis was metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient underwent excision of the hepatic segment where the nodule was located. The pathological diagnosis of the surgical specimen was PH. PH should be considered in the differential diagnosis of new liver lesions in patients whose clinical settings do not clearly favor metastasization. Clinicians and radiologists must recognize these lesions to minimize the probability of misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-84873917844.xml,"Several case reports deal with the relationship between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and pulmonary or hepatic sarcoidosis. Most publications describe interferon α-induced sarcoidosis. However, HCV infection per se is also suggested to cause sarcoidosis. The present case report describes a case of biopsy-verified lung and liver sarcoidosis and HCV infection, and the outcome of antiviral therapy. In March 2009, a 25-year-old man presented with moderately elevated liver enzymes without any clinical symptoms. The patient was positive for HCV antibodies and HCV RNA of genotype 1b. Four months later the patient became dyspnoic and pulmonary sarcoidosis was diagnosed by lung biopsy and radiography. A short course of corticosteroid treatment relieved symptoms. Three months later, liver biopsy showed noncaseating granulomas consisting of epithelioid histiocytes and giant cells with a small amount of peripheral lymphocyte infiltration, without any signs of fibrosis. Chronic HCV infection with coexistence of pulmonary and hepatic sarcoidosis was diagnosed. Antiviral therapy with peginterferon α and ribavirin at standard doses was started, which lasted 48 wk, and sustained viral response was achieved. A second liver biopsy showed disappearance of granulomas and chest radiography revealed normalization of mediastinal and perihilar glands. The hypothesis that HCV infection per se may have triggered systemic sarcoidosis was proposed. Successful treatment of HCV infection led to continuous remission of pulmonary and hepatic sarcoidosis. Further studies are required to understand the relationship between systemic sarcoidosis and HCV infection. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved."

This information is then used to generate the new arms race prediction: differences in genitalic form among congeneric species in which females are protected should be less common than differences among congeneric species in which females are vulnerable to harassment by males. This prediction was tested using a sample of 361 genera of insects and spiders. The prediction clearly failed, even when the data were adjusted to take into account several possible biases. Comparative analyses within particular taxonomic groups also failed to show the predicted trends, as did less extensive data on other non-genitalic male display traits. Arms races, as defined in some recent models, seem to have been less important in male-female coevolution of genitalic structures than has been suggested. By elimination, alternative interpretations, such as traditional female choice, which do not predict associations between female protection from harassment and rapid divergent evolution, are strengthened."

To estimate the real costs of allogeneic haematopoetic stem-cell transplantation and to compare these with the historically determined budgets that are made available for this purpose (€ 70,038 for genetically related donors and € 76,826 for unrelated donors). Design. Cost analysis. Methods. In the period 1994-1999, the direct medical costs (price level of 1998) of bone-marrow transplantation from related donors (BMT), stem-cell transplantation from unrelated donors (VUD-SCT) and allogeneic peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) from related donors were determined on the basis of data on adult patients with either acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 66) or acute lymphocytic leukaemia (n = 31). First, the medical resource use by these patients was determined and multiplied by the unit costs of each of the items. Second, a structural programme for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation brings along costs that are not evident from the registration of the medical resource use (e.g., the costs of pre-transplantation screening and the selection of the donor). The costs of these items were calculated by taking inventory in the hospitals and assessed by experts. Results. The average costs per transplanted patient were € 98,334 (BMT), € 151,754 (VUD-SCT) and € 98,977 (PBSCT) during the first two years after transplantation. The greater part of the costs was incurred in the transplantation phase. In VUD-SCT, one-third of the total cost was due to the costs of finding a suitable donor."
2-s2.0-1642377054.xml,"A serious crisis is identified in theories of neurocomputation, marked by a persistent disparity between the phenomenological or experiential account of visual perception and the neurophysiological level of description of the visual system. In particular, conventional concepts of neural processing offer no explanation for the holistic global aspects of perception identified by Gestalt theory. The problem is paradigmatic and can be traced to contemporary concepts of the functional role of the neural cell, known as the Neuron Doctrine. In the absence of an alternative neurophysiologically plausible model, I propose a perceptual modeling approach, to model the percept as experienced subjectively, rather than modeling the objective neurophysiological state of the visual system that supposedly subserves that experience. A Gestalt Bubble model is presented to demonstrate how the elusive Gestalt principles of emergence, reification, and invariance can be expressed in a quantitative model of the subjective experience of visual consciousness. That model in turn reveals a unique computational strategy underlying visual processing, which is unlike any algorithm devised by man, and certainly unlike the atomistic feed-forward model of neurocomputation offered by the Neuron Doctrine paradigm. The perceptual modeling approach reveals the primary function of perception as that of generating a fully spatial virtual-reality replica of the external world in an internal representation. The common objections to this ""picture-in-the-head"" concept of perceptual representation are shown to be ill founded. © 2003 Cambridge University Press."

2-s2.0-1542279137.xml,"Bakeries use sourdoughs to improve bread properties such as flavor and shelf life. The degradation of gluten proteins during fermentation may, however, crucially alter the gluten network formation. We observed changes that occurred in the HMW glutenins during wheat sourdough fermentations. As fermentation starters, we used either rye sourdough or pure cultures of lactobacilli and yeast. In addition, we incubated wheat flour (WF) in the presence of antibiotics under different pH conditions. The proteolytic activities of cereal and sourdough-derived proteinases were studied with edestin and casein. During sourdough fermentations, most of the highly polymerized HMW glutenins degraded. A new area of alcohol-soluble proteins (≈30.000 MW) appeared as a result of the proteolytic breakdown of gluten proteins. Very similar changes were observable as WF was incubated in the presence of antibiotics at pH 3.7. Cereal and sourdough-derived proteinases hydrolyzed edestin at pH 3.5 but showed no activity at pH 5.5. An aspartic proteinase inhibitor (pepstatin A) arrested 88-100% of the activities of sourdough enzymes. According to these results, the most active proteinases in wheat sourdoughs were the cereal aspartic proteinases. Acidic conditions present in sourdoughs create an ideal environment for cereal aspartic proteinases to be active against gluten proteins."
2-s2.0-1642393306.xml,"Background: In a great many situations within health care and treatment, children are subjected to unnecessary pain and suffering. When local anaesthetics is to be administered the child can experience this as incomprehensible especially when the nursing staff assures the child that no pain would be felt, only to discover soon after, that it actually did hurt at the moment of anaesthetic infiltration. The soothing of pain during the suturing of wounds in emergency wards can be reduced, ensuring that unnecessary pain in the cafe-and-treatment process is mot meted out to children. In order to prevent this (subjection to unnecessary pain), and by improving accepted practice, it was interesting to investigate whether children felt pain at the time of infiltration anaesthesia following the initial topical anaesthesia. Aim: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of introductory topical anaesthesia using Xylocain solution dropped in the wound prior to a definitive infiltration-anaesthesia. An experimental, prospective design was used where children were included in either an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group (n=10) were given a Xylocain solution while the control group (n=10) received physiological Sodium solution. Data collection for the study was made by making VAS estimates and by interviews. Result: The study shows that a certain alleviation of pain does occur when using Xylocain but no statistically significant difference exists between the two groups. Irrespective of whether the children received an introductory topical anaesthesia with Xylocain or Sodium solution at the time of infiltration anaesthesia, they expressed pain in connection with infiltration. The study also shows that many children express fear and anxiety. Conclusion: Current research highlights the difficulties involved in offering children a really satisfactory form of pain relief in connection with infiltration anaesthesia and suturing of wounds. It is urgent to throw more light on children's pain, both from a nursing and from a medical point of view. No statistically significant difference was found in children's reported pain, after treatment with Xylocain but the solution can have a positive effect at the time of the infiltration jab, but a larger study needs to be done in order to establish this firmly. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-1642485008.xml,"A rheo-optical methodology, based on small angle light scattering and transmitted light intensity measurements, has been used to study in situ and on a time resolved basis the shear induced morphology in ternary two-phase water-gelatin-dextran mixtures. Emulsions close to the binodal line as well as far from it have been investigated. It is shown that above a critical shear rate, shear-induced mixing occurs at the length scales probed by the laser light. It is hypothesized that the shear-induced homogenization is due to the shear forces that exceed the intermolecular forces of the self-association process of the gelatin. The isothermal phase diagram at a fixed shear rate has been determined. In addition, the structure evolution after cessation of flow has been studied. When flow is stopped after homogenization, phase separation occurs almost instantaneously. When subsequently applying a low shear rate, the structure coarsens due to coalescence of the dispersed droplets. The kinetics of this coalescence process is strain controlled. © 2004 American Chemical Society."

A new mathematical model of the nonlinear mixing system has been developed culminating in the formulation of a stable unique inverse solution, which has an identical structure to the multilayer neural network. In addition, it is shown how the optimum framework for the nonlinear demixing system can be obtained directly from the derived mixing model. It is further shown how the proposed schemes using the multilayer polynomial neural network (PNN) can be utilised to acquire the desired solution. Moreover, the corresponding learning algorithm based on the generalised stochastic gradient descent method combined with a modified genetic algorithm (GA) has been developed to yield a novel and more effective approach in updating the parameters of the PNN. Both synthetic and real-time simulations have been conducted to verify the efficacy of each proposed scheme."

METHODS: Using a prospective database, the patients undergoing fully robotic surgery for biliary malignancies between January 2009 and January 2011 were included. Records of patients with confirmed malignancy were reviewed for clinicopathological data and information about PSM. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with biliary tract cancers underwent robotic surgery, and sixty patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 67 year (range: 40-85 year). During a median 15-mo follow-up period, two female patients were detected solitary PSM after robotic surgery. The incidence of PSM was 3.3%. Patient 1 underwent robotic anatomatic left hemihepatectomy and extraction of biliary tumor thrombi for an Klatskin tumor. She had a subcutaneous mass located at the right lateral abdominal wall near a trocar scar. Patient 2 underwent robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy for distal biliary cancer. She had two metachronous subcutaneous mass situated at the right lateral abdominal wall under a same trocar scar at 7 and 26 mo. The pathology of the excised PSM masses confirmed metastatic biliary adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: The incidence of PSMs after robotic surgery for biliary malignancies is relatively low, and biliary cancer can be an indication of robotic surgery. © 2012 Baishideng.

After this period, depending on the degree of improvement dosage was reduced to 3-4 mg./ Kgr and treatment was given every 8 weeks or more. The total treatment lasted up to 52 weeks. Ten patients also received concomitant methotrexate treatment and five received cyclosporine treatment. The other patients were naïve to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD's). Patients were on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's) and 14 were also on prednisolone (≤10 mg/day). All patients had active psoriatic arthritis with poliarticular disease (≥5 active joints). The earliest improvement, which was strongly statistically significant, was detected by week 10. By week 16 improvement was at the maximum and was thereafter maintained throughout the study. At week 16 patients had an ACR20 response of 66%, ACR50 was 47% and ACR70 was 27%. At month 6 ACR20 response was 70%, ACR50 was 51% and ACR70 was 31% respectively. At that time only 4 patients continued with previous methotrexate treatment and one with cyclosporine. Two patients continued prednisolone up to 5 mg on alternate days and NSAID's were reduced to periodic usage. A rapid and significant improvement in psoriatic skin lesions was detected by week 16. This was sustained through to week 26 and for the remaining duration of the study. The PASI skin score showed a 50% improvement from baseline in 65% of the patients and 33% had a 75% improvement. At week 52, 29% of patients had 0 tender joints, 27% had no swollen joints and 40% had a HAQ disability score of zero. One patient discontinued treatment because of no improvement by week 18. No serious side effects were reported and treatment was well tolerated by the patients. There were no. serious infections or laboratory abnormalities.

METHODS: Retrospective observational study in a Tertiary Referral Centre. Between January 1999-October 2005, we identified 37 patients who were endoscopically treated with human thrombin injection therapy for bleeding gastric and ectopic varices. Patient details including age, gender and aetiology of liver disease/ segmental portal hypertension were documented. The thrombin was obtained from the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and prepared to give a solution of 250 IU/mL which was injected via a standard injection needle. All patient case notes were reviewed and the total dose of thrombin given along with the number of endoscopy sessions was recorded. Initial haemostasis rates, rebleeding rates and mortality were catalogued along with the incidence of any immediate complications which could be attributable to the thrombin therapy. The duration of follow up was also listed. The study was conducted according to the United Kingdom research ethics guidelines. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included. 33 patients (89%) had thrombin (250 U/mL) for gastric varices, 2 (5.4%) for duodenal varices, 1 for rectal varices and 1 for gastric and rectal varices. (1) Gastric varices, an average of 15.2 mL of thrombin was used per patient. Re-bleeding occurred in 4 patients (10.8%), managed in 2 by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) (one unsuccessfully who died) and in other 2 by a distal splenorenal shunt; (2) Duodenal varices (or type 2 isolated gastric varices), an average of 12.5 mL was used per patient over 2-3 endoscopy sessions. Re-bleeding occurred in one patient, which was treated by TIPSS; and (3) Rectal varices, an average of 18.3 mL was used per patient over 3 endoscopy sessions. No re-bleeding occurred in this group.

After the 2-wk 40 mg prednisolone trial, the patient's symptoms and bilirubin level improved significantly. A follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan showed a dramatic resolution of the pancreatic lesion. A low dose steroid was continued. After six months he self-discontinued prednisolone for 3 wk, and was presented with jaundice again. A CT scan showed newly developed intrahepatic biliary dilatation and marked concentric wall thickening of the common hepatic duct and the proximal common bile duct without pancreatic aggravation. The patient' s IgG4 level was elevated to 2.51 g/L. Prednisolone was started again, after which his serum bilirubin level became normal and the thickening of the bile duct was resolved. This case suggests that autoimmune pancreatitis can progress to other organs that are not involved at the initial diagnosis, even with sustained pancreatic remission. © 2012 Baishideng.

2-s2.0-84873908678.xml,"AIM: To investigate the protective effect and mechanisms of ghrelin postconditioning against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced injury in human gastric epithelial cells. METHODS: The model of H/R injury was established in gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1) human gastric epithelial cells. Cells were divided into seven groups: normal control group (N); H/R postconditioning group; DMSO postconditioning group (DM); ghrelin postconditioning group (GH); D-Lys3-GHRP-6 + ghrelin postconditioning group (D + GH); capsazepine + ghrelin postconditioning group (C + GH); and LY294002 + ghrelin postconditioning group (L + GH). 3-(4,5-dimethylthazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to detect GES-1 cell viability. Hoechst 33258 fluorochrome staining and flow cytometry were conducted to determine apoptosis of GES-1 cells. Spectrophotometry was performed to determine release of lactate dehydrogenate (LDH). Protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β was determined by western blotting. Expression of vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1), Akt and GSK-3β was observed by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the H/R group, cell viability of the GH group was significantly increased in a dosedependent manner (55.9% ± 10.0% vs 69.6% ± 9.6%, 71.9% ± 17.4%, and 76.3% ± 13.3%). Compared with the H/R group, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the GH group significantly decreased (12.38% ± 1.51% vs 6.88% ± 0.87%). Compared with the GH group, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the D + GH group, C + GH group and L + GH groups significantly increased (11.70% ± 0.88%, 11.93% ± 0.96%, 10.20% ± 1.05% vs 6.88% ± 0.87%). There were no significant differences in the percentage of apoptotic cells between the H/R and DM groups (12.38% ± 1.51% vs 13.00% ± 1.13%). There was a significant decrease in LDH release following ghrelin postconditioning compared with the H/R group (561.58 ± 64.01 U/L vs 1062.45 ± 105.29 U/L). There was a significant increase in LDH release in the D + GH, C + GH and L + GH groups compared with the GH group (816.89 ± 94.87 U/L, 870.95 ± 64.06 U/L, 838.62 ± 118.45 U/L vs 561.58 ± 64.01 U/L). There were no significant differences in LDH release between the H/R and DM groups (1062.45 ± 105.29 U/L vs 1017.65 ± 68.90 U/L). Compared with the H/R group, expression of Bcl-2 and Akt increased in the GH group, whereas expression of Bax and GSK- 3β decreased. Compared with the GH group, expression of Bcl-2 decreased and Bax increased in the D + GH, C + GH and L + GH groups, and Akt decreased and GSK-3β increased in the L + GH group. The H/R group also upregulated expression of VR1 and GSK-3β and downregulated Akt. The number of VR1-positive and Akt-positive cells in the GH group significantly increased, whereas the number of GSK-3β-positive cells significantly decreased. These effects of ghrelin were reversed by capsazepine and LY294002. CONCLUSION: Ghrelin postconditioning protected against H/R-induced injury in human gastric epithelial cells, which indicated that this protection might be associated with GHS-R, VR1 and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. © 2012 Baishideng.

Specific mechanical energy transferred to the dough during extrusion decreased 69% for semolina and 79% for semolina containing 30%, w/w, buckwheat bran flour, as hydration level increased 29-32% absorption. Little or no postdrier checking occurred in spaghetti made from semolina or spaghetti containing buckwheat bran flour when dried at high (70°C) or ultrahigh temperature (90°C). When dried at low temperature (40°C), tolerance to postdrier checking of spaghetti decreased as buckwheat bran flour increased 0-30% (w/w). Hydration level before extrusion did not affect cooking loss of spaghetti made from semolina. However, cooking loss was greater from spaghetti made with semolina-buckwheat bran flour that was hydrated to 32% compared with 29-31% absorption. Cooked firmness of spaghetti containing buckwheat bran flour decreased from 0.588-0.471 Nm as hydration increased from 29-32% absorption. Cooking loss was lower and cooked firmness was greater when spaghetti containing buckwheat bran flour was dried at ultrahigh than at low temperature."

Performance monitoring involves both efficiency (costs) and effectiveness (quality) measures; however, there is little guidance from the literature to indicate the best approaches in different contexts. This paper therefore reports on an exploratory study in which approaches to performance monitoring, and respondents' views on best practice, were explored in contracted services. Key findings are that organisations rely on inspections by their own employees or contractor checklists, but that these practices are in conflict with their views on best practice. However, the respondents agreed that performance monitoring has a large effect on quality outcomes. Using both the literature and the study, a model has been developed that provides managers with a framework for improving their performance and quality monitoring practices, and highlights areas for future academic research. © MCB UP Ltd."
2-s2.0-1442348279.xml,"Objectives: To describe the clinical presentation and course of a relatively large group of Italian adult patients screened for mutation of the homogentisate dioxygenase gene causing alkaptonuria (AKU) and ochronosis, and to review typical and atypical facets of this condition. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 9 patients affected by ochronotic arthropathy who were observed in our institutions between 1979 and 2001. All patients were diagnosed as having AKU through a rapid urine test with alkali. Mutation screening was performed by single-strand conformation analysis of all homogentisate dioxygenase exons, followed by sequencing of altered conformers. Results: Our 9 cases had similar clinical features and they reflected those described in the literature: a progressive degenerative arthropathy mainly affecting axial and weight-bearing joints associated with extraarticular manifestation. Musculoskeletal symptoms began in most of our patients around the age of 30 years with back pain and stiffness: involvement of the large peripheral joints usually occurred several years after spinal changes. Ochronotic peripheral arthropathy generally was degenerative, but joint inflammation was observed in some cases; this could be attributed to an inflammatory reaction of the ochronotic shard in the synovial membrane. Conclusions: Ochronosis is a model of arthropathy with known etiologic factors. Over time, AKU, the genetically determined metabolic defect, leads to the accumulation of pigment and the development of this crippling condition. Most of the clinical findings may be explained by inhibition of collagen crosslinks, but some require additional interpretation. For example, inflammatory features of the ochronotic joint only occur in a minority of cases, and may be attributable to ochronotic shards. Further studies are needed to establish the genotype-phenotype correlation to identify mutations that are predictive of severe disease. For this purpose, the Italian Study Group on Alkaptonuria (www.dfc.unifi.it/aku) is enrolling affected patients in an on-line database to characterize the molecular defects and their relationship to clinical data. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

A 57-yearold male, who had undergone total pelvic exenteration for rectal cancer sixteen months earlier, demonstrated an abnormal uptake within his penis by positron emission tomography/computed tomography. A single elastic nodule of the middle penis shaft was noted deep within Bucks fascia. No other obvious recurrent site was noted except the penile lesion. Total penectomy was performed as a curative resection based on a diagnosis of isolated penile metastasis from rectal cancer. A histopathological examination revealed an increase of well differentiated adenocarcinoma in the corpus spongiosum consistent with his primary rectal tumor. The immunohistochemistry of the tumor cells demonstrated positive staining for cytokeratin 20 and negative staining for cytokeratin 7, which strongly supported a diagnosis of penile metastasis from the rectum.

2-s2.0-84873931352.xml,"Peritoneal surface malignancies are generally associated with poor prognosis. In daily clinical routine, systemic chemotherapy is still considered the only reasonable therapy despite of encouraging results of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) along with intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (HIPEC). The Achilles heel of CRS and HIPEC is appropriate patient selection and precise surgical technique preventing patients from excessive morbidity and mortality. Given these findings, new concepts of second look surgery for high risk patients allow detection of peritoneal spread ahead of clinical symptoms or presence of peritoneal masses reducing perioperative morbidity. In addition, personalized intraperitoneal chemotherapy might further improve outcome by appreciating individual tumor biology. These days, every physician should be aware of CRS and HIPEC for treatment of peritoneal surface malignancies. Since there is now sufficient data for the superiority of CRS and HIPEC to systemic chemotherapy in selected patients, our next goal should be providing this strategy with minimal morbidity and mortality even in the presence of higher tumor load. © 2012 Baishideng.

2-s2.0-1542513476.xml,"Summary Numerous clinical findings indicate that viscosity of laryngeal mucosa is a crucial factor in glottal perfomance. Experience using experimental test benches has shown the importance of humidifying air stream used to induce vibration in excised larynges. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge particularly regarding the physicochemical properties of laryngeal mucus. The purpose of this study was to research vocal fold vibration in excised larynges using artificial mucus of precisely known viscosity. Eight freshly harvested porcine larynges were examined. Parameters measured were Fo and vocal fold contact time. Measurements were performed under three conditions: basal (no fluid application on vocal cord surface), after application of a fluid of 60cP viscosity (Visc60), and after application of a fluid of 100cP viscosity (Visc 100). Electroglottographic measurements were performed at two different times for each condition: 1 s after airflow onset (T1) and 6 seconds after airflow onset (T2). Statistical analysis consisted of comparing data obtained under each condition at T1 and T2. The results showed a significant decrease in Fo after application of Visc60 and Visc100 fluids and a decrease in Fo at T2. Closure time was significantly higher under Visc60 conditions and under Visc100 conditions than under basal conditions. Application of artificial mucus to the mucosa of the vocal folds lowered vibratory frequency and prolonged the contact phase. Our interpretation of this data is that the presence of mucus on the surface of the vocal folds generated superficial tension and caused adhesion, which is a source of nonlinearity in vocal vibration."

Existing conceptual research relating to interorganizational relationships and networks is reviewed in terms of its relevance to understanding supply networks; this research is drawn from the fields of strategic management, channel management, industrial marketing and purchasing, organizational behaviour and supply-chain management. The different perspectives each field has on networks are highlighted. Contributions made by each in assisting to understand supply networks are discussed and synthesized. Findings from an exploratory survey are used to structure the design of a conceptual model for analysing the processes involved in the creation and operation of supply networks. The authors identify nine different types of networking activities and discuss the nature of these activities in the context of supply. Four different types of contextual factors relating to supply networks are identified. The model is tested in eight in-depth case studies and a validating survey of 58 focal firm networks. It is concluded that it provides a robust structure that enabled complex, cross-case analysis of multi-variable, multi-disciplinary data from interorganization product/service supply networks, but that further testing by other researchers is required."

METHODS: This is a single-center comparative effectiveness pilot study. Polyps (n = 103) from 75 averagerisk adult outpatients undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy between December 1, 2010 and April 1, 2011 were evaluated by two participating endoscopists in an academic outpatient endoscopy center. Polyps were evaluated both with high-definition white light and with i-SCAN to make an in vivo prediction of adenomatous vs non-adenomatous pathology. We determined diagnostic characteristics of i-SCAN and highdefinition white light, including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, with regards to identifying adenomatous vs non-adenomatous polyps. Histopathologic diagnosis was the gold standard comparison. RESULTS: One hundred and three small polyps, detected from forty-three patients, were included in the analysis. The average size of the polyps evaluated in the analysis was 3.7 mm (SD 1.3 mm, range 2 mm to 8 mm). Formal histopathology revealed that 54/103 (52.4%) were adenomas, 26/103 (25.2%) were hyperplastic, and 23/103 (22.3%) were other diagnoses include ""lymphoid aggregates"", ""non-specific colitis,"" and ""no pathologic diagnosis."" Overall, the combined accuracy of endoscopists for predicting adenomas was identical between i-SCAN (71.8%, 95%CI: 62.1%-80.3%) and high-definition white light (71.8%, 95%CI: 62.1%-80.3%). However, the accuracy of each endoscopist differed substantially, where endoscopist A demonstrated 63.0% overall accuracy (95%CI: 50.9%-74.0%) as compared with endoscopist B demonstrating 93.3% overall accuracy (95%CI: 77.9%-99.2%), irrespective of imaging modality. Neither endoscopist demonstrated a significant learning effect with i-SCAN during the study. Though endoscopist A increased accuracy using i-SCAN from 59% (95%CI: 42.1%-74.4%) in the first half to 67.6% (95%CI: 49.5%-82.6%) in the second half, and endoscopist B decreased accuracy using i-SCAN from 100% (95%CI: 80.5%-100.0%) in the first half to 84.6% (95%CI: 54.6%-98.1%) in the second half, neither of these differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: i-SCAN and high-definition white light had similar efficacy predicting polyp histology.

2-s2.0-1442301827.xml,"Alkaline conditions are generally preferred for sanitization of chromatography media by cleaning-in-place (CIP) protocols in industrial biopharmaceutical processes. The use of such rigorous conditions places stringent demands on the stability of ligands intended for use in affinity chromatography. Here, we describe efforts to meet these requirements for a divalent proteinaceous human serum albumin (HSA) binding ligand, denoted ABD*dimer. The ABD*dimer ligand was constructed by genetic head-to-tail linkage of two copies of the ABD* moiety, which is a monovalent and alkali-stabilized variant of one of the serum albumin-binding motifs of streptococcal protein G. Dimerization was performed to investigate whether a higher HSA-binding capacity could be obtained by ligand multimerization. We also investigated the influence on alkaline stability and HSA-binding capacity of three variants (VDANS, VDADS and GGGSG) of the inter-domain linker. Biosensor binding studies showed that divalent ligands coupled using non-directed chemistry demonstrate an increased molar HSA-binding capacity compared with monovalent ligands. In contrast, equal molar binding capacities were observed for both types of ligands when using directed ligand coupling chemistry involving the introduction and recruitment of a unique C-terminal cysteine residue. Significantly higher molar binding capacities were also detected when using the directed coupling chemistry. These results were confirmed in affinity chromatography binding capacity experiments, using resins containing thiol-coupled ligands. Interestingly, column sanitization studies involving exposure to 0.1 M NaOH solution (pH 13) showed that of all the tested constructs, including the monovalent ligand, the divalent ligand construct containing the VDADS linker sequence was the most stable, retaining 95% of its binding capacity after 7 h of alkaline treatment."

We identified 23 loci responsible for such variation, many of which appear to correspond to genes not previously implicated in controlling organ morphology. These analyses also demonstrated that allelic differences at distinct loci can independently affect petal length, width, area or shape, suggesting that these traits behave as independent modules. We also showed that ERECTA (ER), encoding a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like serine-threonine kinase, is a major effect locus determining petal shape. Allelic variation at the ER locus was associated with differences in petal cell proliferation and concomitant effects on petal shape. ER has been previously shown to be required for regulating cell division and expansion in other contexts; the ER receptor-like kinase functioning to also control organ-specific proliferation patterns suggests that allelic variation in common signaling components may nonetheless have been a key factor in morphological diversification. © 2013 Abraham et al."
2-s2.0-1642263722.xml,"Oxidative folding is a composite process that consists of both the conformational folding to the native three-dimensional structure and the regeneration of the native disulfide bonds of a protein, frequently involving over 100 disulfide intermediate species. Understanding the oxidative folding pathways of a multiple-disulfide-containing protein is a very difficult task that often requires years of devoted research due to the high complexity of the process and the very similar features of the large number of intermediates. Here we developed a method for rapidly delineating the major features of the oxidative folding pathways of a protein. The method examines the temperature dependence of the oxidative folding rate of the protein in combination with reduction pulses. Reduction pulses expose the presence of structured intermediates along the pathways. The correlation between the regeneration rate at different temperatures and the stability of the structured intermediates reveals the role that the intermediates play in determining the pathway. The method was first tested with bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A whose folding pathways were defined earlier. Then, it was explored to discern some of the major features of the folding pathways of its homologue, frog Onconase. The results suggest that the stability of the three-dimensional structure of the native protein is a major determinant of the folding rate in oxidative folding.

2-s2.0-1442287515.xml,"The comparative analysis of scientific heritage of Richard Goldschmidt and Julian Huxley shows convincingly the resemblance of these two scientists' views over the core problems of evolutionary theory, genetics and development biology. They both contributed to developing a triad ""genetics - development - evolution"". The problem of a relative growth of animals was the central point in both Goldschmidt's and Huxley's works. Huxley developed a formula of the allometric growth (law of constant differential growth) while Goldschmidt was the first to draw up the broad interpretation of the consequences of that phenomenon. Both scientists belonged to initiators of development genetics and used the ""non-morganian"" genetics in their efforts of solving problems of macroevolution. Goldschmidt tended toward an idea of an important role of macromutation in the process of macroevolution, though Huxley adhered to more moderate views. But at the same time the concept of preadaptive mutations proposed by Huxley was close to Goldschmidt's idea of macromutants. It is shown that both scientists analyzed profoundly the changes in early stages of embryogenesis in respect to macroevolution. It is not likely to be reasonable to oppose firmly Goldschmidt's saltationism to the evolutionary synthesis of Huxley. They developed the lager biological problems in a similar way, and undoubtedly their works in the field helped to enrich the development of the views over genetics and evolution. The open-minded analysis of Goldschmidt's and Huxley's concepts leads to creating modern and up-to-date views over the theory of evolution where seemingly incompatible things go together rather well and supplement each other.

During apoptosis, translation undergoes significant down-regulation that correlates with caspase-3 mediated cleavage of several translation factors, including eIF4G, 4EBP1 and eIF2α. The fate of PABP in apoptotic cells has not yet been examined. Here we show that PABP levels decline significantly via proteolytic degradation in apoptotic HeLa, Jurkat and MCF7 cells. The degradation of PABP correlated with translation inhibition but lagged behind cleavage of eIF4GI. In apoptotic MCF7 cells translation inhibition occurred without modification of most translation factors and correlated with PABP degradation. PABP was not cleaved during incubation with several caspases, yet caspase 3 induced weak PABP degradative activity in cells lysates. Both the caspase inhibitor zVAD and calpain inhibitors blocked PABP cleavage in vivo, while the proteosome inhibitor MG132 induced PABP degradation. Protease(s) activated during apoptosis preferentially degraded PABP associated with ribosomes and translation factors, but not PABP in other cellular compartments. The data suggest that targeted degradation of PABP contributes to translation inhibition in apoptotic cells."

Although several nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors select RT mutations K65R and L74V, the combination of 65R + 74V is rare in clinics. A novel NRTI (-)-β-D-dioxolane-guanosine (DXG) is known to select in vitro either the 65R or 74V mutant virus (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 44 (2000) 1783). These mutations were not selected together during repeated passaging of the HIV-1 in the presence of this drug. To analyze the impact of these RT mutations on viral replication, a double mutant containing K65R + L74V was created by site-directed mutagenesis in a pNL4-3 background. Replication kinetic assays revealed that the mutant K65R + L74V is unstable, and 65R→K reversion occurs during replication of virus in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells in the absence of selection pressure. Replication kinetic assays in MT-2 cells demonstrated that double mutant 65R + 74V is highly attenuated for replication and the initiation of reversion is related to the increase in RT activity. Additionally, the suppression of viral replication in the presence of DXG or under suboptimal human recombinant interleukin-2 leads to minimal or no 65R→K reversion. These observations provide evidence that 65R→K reversion in the double mutant 65R + 74V is dependent on a specific rate of viral replication in a pNL4-3 background. A similar phenomenon may occur in vivo, which may have implications for treatment management strategies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

2-s2.0-84873909810.xml,"In most mammals, each hair follicle undergoes a cyclic process of growing, regressing and resting phases (anagen, catagen, telogen, respectively) called the hair cycle. Various biological factors have been reported to regulate or to synchronize with the hair cycle. Some factors involved in the extracellular matrix, which is a major component of skin tissue, are also thought to regulate the hair cycle. We have focused on an enzyme that degrades elastin, which is associated with skin elasticity. Since our previous study identified skin fibroblast elastase as neprilysin (NEP), we examined the fluctuation of NEP enzyme activity and its expression during the synchronized hair cycle of rats. NEP activity in the skin was elevated at early anagen, and decreased during catagen to telogen. The expression of NEP mRNA and protein levels was modulated similarly. Immunostaining showed changes in NEP localization throughout the hair cycle, from the follicular epithelium during early anagen to the dermal papilla during catagen. To determine whether NEP plays an important role in regulating the hair cycle, we used a specific inhibitor of NEP (NPLT). NPLT was applied topically daily to the dorsal skin of C3H mice, which had been depilated in advance. Mice treated with NPLT had significantly suppressed hair growth. These data suggest that NEP plays an important role in regulating the hair cycle by its increased expression and activity in the follicular epithelium during early anagen. © 2013 Morisaki et al."

However, little attention has been paid to the consequences of how scale modifications are made, the criteria that are used to assess how well a modified scale performs, and whether scale modification is in fact worthwhile. To investigate these issues, we review approaches to scale modification, select an influential marketing scale and use context, and then examine the effects of the different scale modification approaches on which items are included in the refined scale. We then cross-validate the psychometric performance of the resulting scales using criteria that reflect the multiple purposes to which a scale can be applied. The results show approaches that leads to a more reliable scale for one purpose (e.g., segmentation) can be far less adequate for another purpose (e.g., benchmarking). © 2004 New York University.

2-s2.0-1642457333.xml,"Immune responses to the intracellular Wolbachia bacteria of filarial nematodes are thought to contribute to the pathologic process of filarial infection. Here, we compare antibody responses of subjects living in an area where lymphatic filariasis is endemic with antibody responses elicited in a murine model of filarial infection, to provide evidence that the infective larval stage (L3), not adult nematodes, are the primary inducer of responses against Wolbachia. In human subjects, antibody responses to Brugia malayi Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) are most often correlated with antibody responses to the L3 stage of B. malayi. Analysis of anti-WSP responses induced in mice by different stages of the rodent filariae Litomosoides sigmodontis shows that the strongest anti-WSP response is elicited by the L3 stage. Although adult filarial nematode death may play a role in the generation of an anti-WSP response, it is the L3 stage that is the major source of immunogenic material, and incoming L3 provide a continual boosting of the anti-WSP response. Significant exposure to the endosymbiotic bacteria may occur earlier in nematode infection than previously thought, and the level of exposure to infective insect bites may be a key determinant of disease progression."

2-s2.0-84873931022.xml,"AIM: To undertake a metasynthesis of qualitative studies to understand the health and social needs of people living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: A systematic search strategy identified qualitative studies exploring the phenomenon of living with inflammatory bowel disease. Databases included MEDLINE, PsychInfo, EMBASE, CINAHL and the British Nursing Index via the OVID platform. Qualitative search filters were adapted from Hedges database (http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/hslt/miner/ digital_library/tip_sheets/Cinahl_eb_filters.pdf). Qualitative empirical studies exploring the health and social needs of people living with inflammatory bowel disease were selected. Study eligibility and data extraction were independently completed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative studies. The studies were analysed and synthesised using metasynthesis methodology. The themes from the studies allowed for common translations into a new interpretation of the impact of living with inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS: Of 1395 studies, six published studies and one unpublished thesis fulfilled the inclusion criteria. First iteration of synthesis identified 16 themes, 2nd iteration synthesised these into three main 2nd order constructs: ""detained by the disease""; ""living in a world of disease"" and ""wrestling with life"". ""Detained by the disease"" is the fear of incontinence, the behaviour the patients display due to the fear, and the impact this has on the individual, such as social isolation and missing out on life events. All of these serve to ""pull"" the patient back from normal living. ""Living in a world of disease"" is the long term effects of living with a long term condition and the fear of these effects. ""Wrestling with life"" is the continued fight to thrive, the ""push"" to continue normal living. CONCLUSION: The metasynthesis provides a comprehensive representation of living with IBD. The unmistakeable burden of incontinence is exposed and its ongoing effects are demonstrated. The combined overall impact of living with IBD is the tension these patients live with: ""Pushed and pulled: a compromised life"", people living with IBD experience a constant conflict throughout their lives, they push to be normal but IBD pulls them back. The impact of the fear of incontinence and behaviour of the individual as a result, requires further qualitative enquiry. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved."

The purpose of this study is to explore the organisational value of participating in a quality award process. The study is based on interviews at 29 organisations that have participated in the process of the Swedish Quality Award. The main conclusion is that most of the organisations consider the process orientation, customer orientation and improvement work to have been improved as a result of the participation in the quality award process. However, there are also obstacles to surmount in order to benefit fully from the process: difficulties in finding resources within the organisation to perform mandatory work and implement identified improvements, and difficulties in applying the circumstantial model used in the quality award process."

However, employee governance is rare in advanced market economies due to its relative inefficiency compared with shareholder governance. Given this inefficiency, should employee governance be given up as an impractical ideal? This article contends that the debate over this question is hampered by an inadequate conception of employee governance that fails to take into account the difference between employees and shareholders. It offers a different, more adequate conception of employee governance that recognizes a sense in which employees currently have some ownership rights. The argument for this conception of employee governance is built on an expanded understanding of the ownership of a firm.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of AQP1 and AQP4 in human brain after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and in peritumoral tissue by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The results showed a marked increase of the expression of AQP1 and AQP4. This over-expression occurred on the astrocytic processes and polarization on astrocytic end-feet was lost. No expression was observed on neuronal cells. This study is the first demonstration of the induction of AQP1 and AQP4 on reactive astrocytes in an acute brain injury, such as SAH.

Therefore, extensive research concerning the reduction of fine particle emissions is needed to further improve air quality. Regarding health effects, especially the emission characteristics of fine and ultrafine particles emerging from anthropogenic sources such as combustion processes are of special interest. This study shows that the emission characteristic of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) due to re-entrainment of fine particles and their subsequent release into the atmosphere can be significantly lowered by application of different operating conditions. For this purpose the particle collection efficiency of an ESP was studied in a municipal sewage sludge incineration plant. Particles were sampled under different operating conditions upstream and downstream from the ESP, and the particle number concentrations were measured simultaneously with aerodynamic particle sizers. In addition, the size distribution of the particles downstream from the ESP was measured with high time resolution by an electrical low-pressure impactor to investigate the particle re-entrainment into the flue gas. To determine the influence of operating conditions, different rapping cycles were investigated regarding their impact on the collection efficiency and the subsequent particle re-entrainment."

Clinical pathological classifications are unable to predict the individual risk of recurrence and the prognosis which would also appear to be linked to additional factors, which have yet to be properly assessed, such as the genetic endowment of the tumour. In this study we assessed how microsatellite and chromosomal instability may help us to stratify two classes of risk of recurrence in patients at the same stage. From July 1996 to June 1999 we prospectively collected data on 112 patients (59 male, 53 female) affected by colorectal cancer and undergoing surgery with a radical intent. Biopsies of normal and tumor tissue were submitted to DNA extraction and amplification to evaluate the presence of chromosomal instability (loss of heterozygosity) and microsatellite instability. Analysis of the data revealed that loss of heterozygosity in the long arm of chromosome 18 is associated, in patients with stage III colorectal cancer, with a higher risk of recurrence and therefore with a worse prognosis. Microsatellite instability proved to be associated with a better prognosis even in cases of recurrence."

Methods: QoL issues relating to ED were generated through in-depth quali-tative interviews of 29 patients, literature review and consultation with other healthcare professionals. The issues were formulated into a questionnaire, which was piloted using 40 patients with ED and subsequently refined using well-established principles of questionnaire development. Results: The qualitative interviews revealed numerous psychosocial problems associated with ED, which were operationalised into a 40-item questionnaire. Pilot testing allowed the questionnaire to be reduced to a manageable 15-item final questionnaire while maintaining face and content validity and the potential to discriminate between men with varying degrees of affected QoL. This questionnaire had a Cronbach's α of 0.94. Conclusions: A new ED-specific QoL measure has been developed using appropriate methodology.

2-s2.0-84873920243.xml,"This study investigates the mechanisms by which the ocean diurnal cycle can affect the ocean mean state in the North Atlantic region. We perform two ocean-atmosphere regionally coupled simulations (20°N-80°N, 80°W-40°E) using the CNRMOM1D ocean model coupled to the ARPEGE4 atmospheric model: one with a 1. h coupling frequency (C1h) and another with a 24. h coupling frequency (C24h). The comparison between both experiments shows that accounting for the ocean diurnal cycle tends to warm up the surface ocean at high latitudes and cool it down in the subtropics during the boreal summer season (June-August). In the subtropics, the leading cause for the formation of the negative surface temperature anomalies is the fact that the nocturnal entrainment heat flux overcompensates the diurnal absorption of solar heat flux. Both in the subtropics and in the high latitudes, the surface temperature anomalies are involved in a positive feedback loop: the cold (warm) surface anomalies favour a decrease (increase) in evaporation, a decrease (increase) in tropospheric humidity, a decrease (increase) in downwelling longwave radiative flux which in turn favours the surface cooling (warming). Furthermore, the decrease in meridional sea surface temperature gradient affects the large-scale atmospheric circulation by a decrease in the zonal mean flow. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

Methods. In a cluster randomised trial, 22 GPs were randomly put into two groups: one group was asked to follow the guidelines (YES-GL), the other to continue normal clinical practice (NO-GL). These GPs enrolled 123 patients with COPD and followed them for one year. Results. Patients managed by the YES-GL GPs had more outpatient appointments and specialist consultations and a higher probability of being classified as having severe COPD. The QoL was fairly low in both groups, and all other clinical outcomes taken into consideration, were not affected by application of the guidelines. Conclusion. The guidelines did not substantially alter the clinical evolution of COPD patients, even though some facets of management improved."

Measurement of exhaled NO may be useful when the diagnosis is doubtfull and for differentiation from other causes of chronic cough. Nasal NO is usually also increased in asthma but this is related to the frequency of allergic rhinitis in asthmatic patients. However, in patients with nasal polyps and asthma, nasal NO is decreased in proportion to the extent of sinusoidal involvement. Levels of exhaled NO decrease rapidly in asthmatic patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. Further studies are needed to establish more precisely the place of exhaled NO measurement in monitoring the control of asthma, especially in comparison with other non-invasive markers of bronchial inflammation. © 2003 Elsevier SAS.

One major challenge to its management is achieving continuous, noninvasive and painless monitoring of glucose concentrations. A new series of fluorescence-based glucose-sensing contact lenses promises to allow continuous monitoring of physiological blood glucose levels by reporting on the minute concentrations and fluctuations of glucose in tears."
2-s2.0-84873933347.xml,"Current soil quality evaluation does not include an assessment of metal bioavailability to organisms. However, sentinel soil-dwelling invertebrates can be used for such an assessment. This study aims to establish the modulating soil parameter of metal bioavailability to snails and a procedure for ranking field sites (n = 9; 43 plots) based on the evaluation of the transfer of metals to the land snails used as indicators of metal zooavailability. Multivariate regressions identify soil pH, organic carbon and iron oxides influence cadmium, chromium, copper, lead and zinc zooavailability to snails underlining the need to consider other parameter than total soil concentration during bioavailability assessment. However, for As, no influence of soil parameter on it bioavailability to snails was identified. Internal Concentrations of Reference (CIRef) of Cd, Pb, As, Cr, Cu and Zn were determined in Cantareus aspersus that were caged on unpolluted plots. CIRef allow for the identification of contaminated sites. CIRef have revealed unexpected metal transfer on some ""unpolluted"" sites and a lack of transfer on some contaminated sites, thus confirming the necessity for biological measures to evaluate metal mobility. The Sum of Excess of Transfers (SET) index ranked the industrially impacted sites as the top priorities for management. We recommend that the SET methodology be used for future environmental risk assessment. By highlighting real metal transfers and considering the numerous parameters influencing environmental bioavailability, the snails watch provides information on environmental quality. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-1542608339.xml,"Lithologically, the rock types in the Gabal El Fereyid area are dominantly granites with minor amounts of pegmatites. The granites range in composition from tonalite to granite-adamallite with minor acidic dikes, quartz and pegmatite veins. The granite-adamallite is peraluminous and formed as a result of partial melting of amphibole-bearing rocks at depths of ∼24-30km and at temperatures of 800-950°C. Among the different rock types, the muscovite-rich pegmatites had the highest U and Th contents (66 and 38ppm on average, respectively). The high level of radioactivity in pegmatites is attributed to the presence of the radioactive minerals thorianite, uranophane and allanite as confirmed by XRD analysis. Binary relations of Zr/U, Zr/Th, Ce/ U and Ce/Th against either U or Th in the granite-adamellite exhibit significant negative correlations indicating that both elements are not preferentially hosted in the accessory minerals phases such as zircon and monazite, but could be associated with major forming minerals such as biotite, muscovite, plagioclase and quartz, or U is situated within labile sites within granite. The uranium and thorium enrichment in the pegmatites is a two-stage process. The primary stage is magmatic whereas the secondary enrichment is from hydrothermal concentration. The magmatic U and Th are indicated by the presence of thorianite and allanite, whereas evidence of hydrothermal mineralization is the alteration of rock-forming minerals such as feldspar and the formation of secondary minerals such as uranophane and pyrite. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-1542314932.xml,"Structured documentation of medical procedures facilitates information retrieval for research and therapy and may help to improve patient care. Most medical documents until today however consist mainly of unstructured narrative text. Here we present an application for endoscopy which is not only fully integrated into a comprehensive clinical information system, but which also supports various degrees of structuring examination reports. The application is used routinely in a German University hospital since summer 2000. We present the first unstructured version which permits storage of a free text report together with selected examination images. The next step added improved structure to the document using a catalogue of index terms. The practical advantages of selective patient retrieval are described. Today we use a version which supports fully structured, guideline based documentation of endoscopy reports in order to automatically generate essential classification codes and the narrative examination report All versions have advantages and disadvantages and we conclude that guideline based documentation may not be suitable for all endoscopy cases."

2-s2.0-1642441484.xml,"This paper investigates quality management practices and performance of more than twenty-eight hundred manufacturing plants operating in three countries in North America. The main objective of this paper is three-fold. Fist, it investigates if there are significant differences in achieving quality management certifications such as ISO 9000, ISO 14000, and QS 9000. Secondly, it examines the extent to which some quality management techniques have been implemented. Thirdly, this paper also examines if there are significant differences in quality performance among manufacturing plants with different level of progress toward achieving World-Class Manufacturing (WCM) status The results of the analyses show significant differences in plants' efforts to achieve quality certifications as well as the extent to which quality management techniques are implemented. The results also show significant differences in quality performance among plants operating in the three countries."
2-s2.0-1542306709.xml,"EUROCARE-3 analysed the survival of 1 815584 adult cancer patients diagnosed from 1990 to 1994 in 22 European countries. The results are reported in tables, one per cancer site, coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 classification. The main findings of the tables are summarised and commented on in this article. For most solid cancers, wide differences in survival between different European populations were found, as also reported by EUROCARE-1 and EUROCARE-2, despite a remarkable (10%) overall increase in cancer survival from 1985 to 1994. Survival was highest in northern Europe (Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland), and fairly good in central-southern Europe (France, Switzerland, Austria and Spain). Survival was particularly low in eastern Europe, low in Denmark and the UK, and fairly low in Portugal and Malta. The mix of tumour stage at diagnosis explains much of the survival differences for cancers of the digestive tract, female reproductive system, breast, thyroid, and also skin melanoma. For tumours of the urinary tract and prostate, the differences were explained mainly by differences in diagnostic criteria and procedures. The case mix by anatomic subsite largely explains differences in survival for head and neck cancers. For oesophagus, pancreas, liver and brain cancer, with poor prognoses, survival differences were limited. Tumours, for which highly effective treatments are available, such as testicular cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma and some haematological malignancies, had fairly uniform survival across Europe. Survival for all tumours combined (an indicator of the overall cancer care performance of a nation's health system) was better in young than old patients, and better in women than men. The affluence of countries influenced overall cancer survival through the availability of adequate diagnostic and treatment procedures, and screening programmes. © 2003 European Society for Medical Oncology."
2-s2.0-1542361341.xml,"This paper reports an optically aligned hot-embossing and imprinting method for biomedical, microfluidic, and microoptical sensors. Hot-embossing technology is a low cost, flexible fabrication method, which has demonstrated high aspect ratio polymer microstructures as well as nanoimprinting patterns. It uses polymer substrates to imprint a pattern created on a master stamp. This allows the stamp to produce many fully patterned substrates for a wide range of materials and short production cycle times, and is therefore suited for applications from rapid prototyping to high volume production. The typical misalignment for mechanical alignment in hot-embossing is in the range of ±50 μm. By contrast, optical alignment accuracy can be achieved within ± 1 μm. This paper will show the principal equipment designs for optical alignment and hot-embossing process on silicon and quartz substrates. Alignment was performed on modified EVG620. In experiment, a. silicon wafers were aligned to silicon stamp using a process mode using digitally generated crosshairs, and b. quartz wafers were aligned to silicon stamp using a transparent alignment mode The EVG620 has been modified so that a vacuum line can be attached to a fitting on the bond tool. During alignment vacuum is applied through this line to hold the stamp to the bond tool. After alignment, the bond tool was transferred to semi automated commercially available EVG520 hot-embossing equipment to emboss the substrates."

For effective, long-term control, this requires that the bacteria are essential to their nematode hosts. Two recent studies offer conflicting evidence: long, close coevolution between most filarial nematodes and their symbionts contrasts with many species having naturally lost them. An attempt to transfer symbionts to an uninfected host found that the bacteria did not thrive, suggesting they are adapted to one host."
2-s2.0-1642506299.xml,Phase and amplitude properties of the fiber bragg gratings was investigated using the interferometric side diffraction technique. The set-up reliability was also analyzed by characterization of some test gratings. It was found that there was a large downfall in the refractive index and phase profiles in the middle part of the gratings. It was observed that some errors can appear due to misalignment of the fiber as a linear fall-off in the measured refractive index profile.

Sequential biopsies were taken during the postexposure period. Slides were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and keratin PAN and high molecular weight cytokeratin and keratin 5. Results: The earliest findings are minimal polymorphonuclear leukocytes extravasation and edema. Heavy inflammation with formation of vesicles and bulla were present at 24 hours. At 6 hours, the upper epidermal cells showed weak staining with high molecular weight cytokeratin and keratin PAN. At 24 and 48 hours, only patchy areas of staining with high molecular weight cytokeratin and keratin 5 were present. Conclusion: One of the major mechanisms of injury by nitrogen mustard may be the disruption of cytoskeletal filament network."

Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed the high diagnostic sensitivity of TNF-R1 measurements (AUC was 0.928) for the diagnosis of adenoma, and the best cut-off level of TNF-R1 was 2.08 ng/mL, with a sensitivity of 93.4% and a specificity of 82.4%. There were no significant differences in the serum levels of TNF-α or sTNF-R2 between the two groups. Immunohistochemistry showed high levels of TNF-R1 and p-JNK expression in the epithelial cells of adenomas. Furthermore, a high incidence of co-localization of TNF-R1 and p-JNK was identified in adenoma tissue. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved."
2-s2.0-1542786858.xml,"The authors analyzed their data of the last three and a half years about patients with temporary loop ileostomy. We formed 18 ileostomies in patients with rectum carcinoma where the anastomosis was performed in the mid or lower rectum. Ten ileostomies were formed because of anastomotic leak, eight to protect the anastomosis, although there were no signs of insufficiency at the time of the intraoperative testing. Sixteen of the 18 patients had no complications. There were two complications in connection with ileostomies, these stomas were closed earlier than usual. Two other patients needed permanent stomas. Fourteen ileostomies were reversed without complications after 6-8 weeks. Two patients with local septic complications, following the closure, were treated conservatively. No reoperations were needed because of anal incontinence or anastomotic stenosis. We consider loop ileostomy safe with low morbidity, it can prevent diffuse peritonitis and/or a permanent stoma. Its routine use is recommended in patients with ""ultra low"" anastomoses and in cases where the intraoperative air test is positive."
